桜桜桜桜桜桜,5.0,带妈妈也算亲子游吧😂 客观的说，我很喜欢这里，有100多种兰花，不是哪里都可以看到这么多品种，真的很漂亮。这里除了有兰花，还有很多叫不上名字的花卉和植物，猪笼草我认识它，小的也就小拇指那么小，大的和我手掌一般大，这个家伙很可爱，夏天太适合家里养一盆。白天室外走路多还是有点吃不消，冷室里面我可以和妈妈一呆就是一两个小时。里面还有很多微景观，值得学习。,07/12/2023,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-180011121?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

The crowning jewel here is undoubtedly the National Orchid Garden, where the riot of colors from countless orchids is almost overwhelming in its beauty. There&#39;s a casual imperfection in the way some plants are labeled, which adds to the charm, giving it a less &#39;manicured&#39; and more &#39;discovered&#39; feel. Swan Lake is another spot of calm - though sometimes the swans can be a little shy, dodging the enthusiastic visitor. While the garden aims to educate with areas like the Ethnobotany Garden, a few of the information plaques have seen better days, showing the wear of time and weather. This isn&#39;t just a tourist stop; it&#39;s a slice of ecological paradise that even locals come back to, time and time again, for peace and a breath of fresh air.",05/11/2023,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-179655766?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

M26***37,5.0,属于植物园里被圈起来的一小块区域，种满了一盆盆大大小小颜色各异的兰花，虽然都挺美的，但外行人也不太懂品种，走马观花没看出更多门道来，只觉得好热，最后草草兜了一圈就出去了。这个园区现场有很多上了年纪的韩国老人排队迎着兰花拍照片，个人其实觉得出片效果和世纪公园里的没什么两样。反倒是植物园随处可见的或高耸、或宽大，或簇拥的树木树丛更让人心旷神怡，既驱散暑气又有浓浓的热带风情。如果不是特别钟爱兰花的人，其实可以不用特意买张门票进来。,30/09/2023,1,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-179166114?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

Many botanical gardens conduct research and conservation efforts to protect endangered plant species and promote ecological awareness.A visit to a botanical garden can be a tranquil and inspiring experience, as you can explore meticulously landscaped grounds, learn about different plant species, and appreciate the artistry of garden design. Many botanical gardens also offer educational programs, workshops, and events for all ages, making them an excellent resource for those interested in horticulture, ecology, and conservation.Whether you&#39;re a nature enthusiast, a student, or simply looking for a peaceful and beautiful setting to unwind, a botanical garden is an ideal destination.

Namangaur,5.0,"Just love our Unesco listed Botanical Gardens so accessible now with the MRT circle line ending at the Bukit Timah Entrance. We arranged to meet at 10am but because the rain got heavier took refuge at the Bees&#39;Knees for coffee until it became a mere drizzle. The cafe was crowded and short-staffed so some customers got impatient but it served a very good croissant and Cappuccino for $7 and $5.50 or $6 respectively. Then we went to our favourite stretches of the Symphony Lake with its statues of Chopin etc, enjoyed the huge lily pads, the one beautiful white swan, the Herconium Garden, bamboo groves, trellis pathway, unusual trees like the Brazilian cannonball and aged banyan. The write-ups were most informative and it was a delight to sight birds like plover, sunbird as well as catch glimpses of salamanders crawling along pathways and staircases. Meanwhile a profusion of bougainvillea, frangipani and other blooms delight your senses while kampong fowl make their way on the grasses,crowing occasionally. We had lunch at The Halia which is now halal with local dishes and international selections like pizza and salad but do make a reservation as space is limited with social distancing requirements now. The food is good though a trifle expensive and they sell bottled jam and sauces. The Orchid enclosure is open to seniors at $1 per pax and there is a small waterfall, spice garden and numerous benches for lounging as well as clean toilets and a water fountain at Cafe Verde.",01/09/2023,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-178746061?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

Bbom comando,5.0,"Have you spotted this eye-catching palm in Palm Valley?The Cuban Petticoat Palm (Copernicia macroglossa) is a palm endemic to central and west Cuba, where it grows in savannahs. It gets its name from the dense layers of dead fronds that persist for many years on its stem, forming a characteristic &ldquo;petticoat&rdquo;. These layers are particularly obvious in younger palms, giving them a stout, shaggy appearance, but they gradually thin out as the palm matures to reveal a slender stem hidden beneath.

lzizs,5.0,植物园免费的，很大，东边一半是以青少年科普教育为主，游客参观的在西半半，除了大片的池塘、各种植物，还能看到在草地上悠闲散步的小动物比如鸽子、山鸡、池塘里的乌龟鱼等等，很多当地青少年在做拓展游戏。园中园胡姬花园绝对值得去，以为不大很快能出来，其实细细转转也得半天至少，里面还有温室、冰室，很多区域展示不同的植物种类。门票五块新加坡元，60以上老人一块。美中不足的是出来时打车不太好打，植物园门口可以等车，但是工作人员说这里不是出租车站，所以车不会特别多要等一阵子，除了门口到马路边可以打到车，但其实我们到了路边一样不是很好打车，很多空车直接开进了隔壁的一家医院里。建议以后去的话还是查好公交车，有很多趟，去市中心很方便。,29/02/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-71308547?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

小白_1912,5.0,"本以为新加坡植物园是绿树成荫的那种，但其实很大一部分是景观园，真的不适合在烈日下行走，尤其是新加坡的大太阳下，十点多钟来到，走半个小时，感觉人就像从水里捞出来一样，直接就想逃离。但新加坡植物园真的很大呀，想从另一个门出去，都走了很久。科普下介绍，下次找个凉爽的天再去。新加坡植物园(英文:SingaporeBotanicGardens)是新加坡首个联合国教科文组织世界文化遗产。植物园位于克伦尼路，占地74公顷，公园最南端距最北端约2.5公里。新加坡植物园是热带岛屿繁茂的缩影，结合了原始树林和专业花圃，拥有20,000多种亚热带、热带的奇异花卉和珍贵的树木，可分为热带、亚热带常绿乔木、棕榈、竹类园艺花卉、水生植物、沼生植物、寄生植物和沙漠植物等植物，包括了许多濒临灭绝的品种。新加坡植物园分为三个核心区域，由南向北依次为:东陵区、中心区和武吉知马游览区。除了位于中心区的国家兰花园需要购票入内，其余区域均免费开放。东陵区主要由植物学中心和天鹅湖构成，这里也是新加坡植物园初期的办公和试验地，著名的历史博物馆、植物图书馆、标本馆都在此处。中心区西部是国家兰花园，东侧紧邻东陵区的是一片约有6公顷的热带雨林，这片珍贵的原始热带森林比植物园的历史还要久远，生长了超过50[%]的新加坡稀有植物物种，也是世界上少有的位于城市内的热带雨林。中心区内有一处栽植着绿篱的矩形花园，花园里有一个圆形的日冕和喷水池。北面的斜坡上铺植草坪，上面有用不同颜色的观叶植物组成的花钟，新颖别致。棕榈谷和交响乐湖在中心区的中央，邵氏基金交响乐台位于交响乐湖上，植物园在每个周末会不定时的安排免费音乐会供游客欣赏。2008年10月10日，交响乐湖的南边树起了一座肖邦的雕像。武吉知马游览区以自然景观为主，包括了生态花园、生态胡、雅格巴拉斯儿童花园、叶花园和藤架园。生态花园是一片天然林区，面积约4公顷，专门收集东南亚的各种经济植物。",20/12/2016,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-93281891?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden

tan***13,5.0,滨海湾花园，可以打卡大半天，非常漂亮。云雾林的阿凡达非常值得体验，从顶楼走下，一路云雾缭绕，拍照很出片，花穹相对一般。擎天树观景台的票，是上到中间最高那颗，上去转一圈。几颗树连着的步道，需要排队。奇幻花园，很漂亮，五颜六色的造型，适合拍照。步行稍远，可以坐接驳车，3新币一个人。晚上的灯光秀在6棵树这边，附近有一个侏罗纪美食广场，吃完正好可以看。灯光秀不出彩一般。,04/08/2023,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-178134116?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

Inspiretion,5.0,"&quot;Gardens by the Bay, what a place, lah! Confirm plus chop, it&#39;s one of the best spots in Singapore. First, the Supertree Grove is like sci-fi movie set, especially at night when they light up. Shiok!Next, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest - wah, like aircon in there. Perfect if the temperature is a bit hot outside. You can see all sorts of plants from different countries. Plus, got seasonal displays, so got something new every visit.The outdoor gardens also steady one. Can walk walk, enjoy the fresh air, and take Instagram-worthy pics at every corner. Don&#39;t forget the OCBC Skyway, where you can see Marina Bay Sands and the whole city skyline.Food also got plenty options around, from food court selling affordable fares including thai food, nasi lemak and pastas to fast food like shake shack and McDonalds. There is even Starbucks there. So, you won&#39;t go hungry, promise.But remember, if you go in the afternoon, take the shuttle service (at Bayfront mrt gardens by the bay exit) to flower dome and cloud garden!

118***00,5.0,滨海湾花园，新加坡地标之一，由于离酒店比较近，就步行，其实从金沙走过去也要20分钟。去的早人比较少，不过正好碰到小学生上户外教学科。滨海湾花园分为2个馆，Flower Dome、Cloud Forest；先去得云雾林，去得早的好处就是人少，但是里面冷气十足，请穿长裤带好外套；分好几层可以坐电梯至最高层，一路往下；花穹馆犹如置身在花园中；各种花朵绽放，色彩缤纷。参观完后本想走一下空中走廊，但天空不作美下雨了，只好晚上再来，真好看灯光秀，晚上人比较多，电梯一般也就7个人放行。总体来说还是值得一看。,01/08/2017,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-117072000?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay
是艾达不是阿达,5.0,这里室外花园是免费的，&ldquo;花穹&rdquo;和&ldquo;云雾林&rdquo;两个区域是收费的室内区域。里面比较冷，建议去的时候带一件长袖的衣服。&ldquo;花穹&rdquo;里种植着来自全球各地的多种植物以及珍稀植物。超多的仙人掌、仙人球和软萌的多肉植物。在植物丛中还有很多精美雕像，龙啊，马啊，羊啊等等。还有一片充满童话色彩的郁金香花园，各类各色的郁金香争奇斗艳，美不胜收。&ldquo;云雾林&rdquo;一进门就看到这35米高人造瀑布，很是壮观。之后坐个电梯上去，在一个像是顶楼花园的地方，这里有兰花、猪笼草、无种子的蕨类植物等。之后漫步&ldquo;云中步道&rdquo;，对于恐高的我来说有点吓人。不过景色还是很不错的。,22/06/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-110047255?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay
夜一大老爷,5.0,如果你对美丽的植物很感兴趣，那海滨花园是一个特别值得你来一趟的地方，它的位置也非常好，就在帆船酒店后面，但你要注意怎么过去，地面是没有过去的马路的，你要在地铁的通道里走，这个我们当时绕了好久才弄明白。花院分室外园区和室内园区，室外的是免费的，也很美，室内需要买票，特别推荐一定要进去看看，里面的景色和植物真的超级美，配合人造瀑布，云里雾里，仿佛在仙境一般，室内园区的门口处还有纪念品商店，都是和植物有关的，还有这种植物做的冰淇淋，挺天然的感觉，没有奶油，不错。,14/06/2017,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-109876223?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

克鲁杰,5.0,滨海湾花园毗邻著名的金沙酒店，这里有植物温室&mdash;&mdash;花穹和云雾林冷室，还有数颗超级树组成的森林，充满了科技感，同时又与环境合二为一。花穹里是各种温室植物，有各种多肉和各种叫不出名字的花卉，还有几颗猴面包树，植物名牌全是英文。。看不懂。冷室模拟了高山不同气候，一座巨型瀑布贯穿了上下七层，推荐游览方式是坐直梯上到顶层，然后沿着高空长廊一层一层观赏。超级树，钢铁的枝丫向天空延伸，树干上缠满了藤蔓，充满科幻感，仿佛到了潘多拉的星球，超级树内部顶上有个餐厅，可以在里面用餐，来超级树一定要上去走一走空中走廊，粗粗的钢索在树中间架起的空中长廊，有风吹过的时候会微微晃动，很有意思，而且景色也很美哦，不过黄昏时为了安全空中走廊会关闭，所以要尽早去。,11/05/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-106568816?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

endlesssummer,5.0,滨海湾花园就在著名的金沙酒店&quot;隔壁&quot;有两个室内植物馆也就是花穹这里上了两张夜景图，觉得门票好贵的没舍得去但是当时意外在办插花类的比赛倒是也一饱眼福。去了空中步道要拍一小会儿队的，也要票的建议票都是网上买，便宜太多。步道会控制人流的，如果想多待会儿得多走动不然会有安保人员赶着你向前走的。我当时待了半个多小时为了等天黑好拍夜景到最后实在是等不及了，夜景图后来在摩天轮上拍的，很漂亮。在空中步道上可以远眺到港口，当然摩天轮什么的景色都在眼前。所以还是蛮推荐的，上面有点微晃，不过保证安全的啦,19/07/2017,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-112199445?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

关裕年guanyunian,5.0,原来在什么地方有人这样描写新加坡的卫生状况，实在有些夸张。1988年带着这种意识来到新加坡，不免有些失望。但是，新加坡确实干净，由于面积小，所以便于管理，搞好卫生那还是容易的。绿化是第一流的，由于得天独厚的地理环境，雨水充沛，在加上本来就是&ldquo;巴掌&rdquo;块的地方，所以到处绿树成阴，鲜花盛开，整个城市是立体化的绿化，因此就成了花园城市。管理是第一流的，在街上，经常可以看到穿着黄马甲的扫地，这些人就是由于毁坏环境，而被罚打扫卫生的，如果有人随地吐痰，那就更加严重了，一般来说没有人敢。,15/11/2018,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-157215136?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

Lai E,4.0,上星期到Singapore遊玩，這已是第二次到濱海灣花園，我們花了20元波幣購買Flower Dome 的入場票，內裏正展示土耳其鬱金香的花展，鬱金香的顏色極富鮮艷是難得一到其風采，當日正值星期六，極多遊人前往欣賞和在哪裏打卡，起初購買門票時我也感覺到有一點貴，但進場欣賞花展示就認為真是物有所值，因為不用親身到土耳其，也能觀賞土耳其特有的鬱金香花展也值回票價。,25/05/2023,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-175947146?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

spencerS,4.0,滨海湾这个地方是来新加坡怎么都绕不开的地方了，不论是去景点打卡，金沙购物吃饭还是乘车经过都看到那些经常出现在风景照片里巨大的钢铁树，没错就是滨海湾花园的标志了，当然这些摩天树区域是免费开放的，真正售票的是那两大温室，个人更喜欢那个有瀑布的，里面的植物更漂亮状态更好，也更有特色，另外那个平面温室感觉一般，虽然也还不错，但是并没惊艳感觉，温室里面的温度很宜人，对比外面三四十度的高温，简直太舒服了，值得多花些时间,23/12/2018,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-157494385?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

陈之豪,4.0,新加坡滨海湾花园是新加坡游玩最最值得前往的景点之一，特别是滨海湾超级树，实在是很壮观。【交通路线】乘坐地铁C或者E线至Bayfront站下车【门票信息】由于滨海湾花园很大，里面分为三块地方，其中植物冷室是需要付钱的。还有滨海湾空中廊桥也是需要付费的。植物冷室成人28新加坡元，3-12岁儿童15新加坡元，华侨银行空中走道(OCBC Skyway)成人5新加坡元，3-12岁儿童3新加坡元。【游玩体验】首先去往的是滨海湾的花穹和云雾林。注意，里面会很凉，所以最好带一家长袖去。华穹里面展示了各国的花朵，所有的鲜花和植物都是鲜活的，展馆里面一年四季保持恒温，里面的鲜花无数，实在是漂亮极了。特别是里面有各种各样的胡姬花，作为新加坡的国花，很是漂亮。游玩时间大约在40分钟左右。出来之后便是前往云雾林，就好像到了仙境一样的，里面的树木还有雨雾以及瀑布，都非常有趣。一般是先上5楼，从楼上玩到楼下。尽管这些都是人为的景观，但是游玩效果还是相当不错的，很值得带小孩子去看看，会增长很多知识。之后便要去到滨海花园属滨海南花园，其中建有多棵巨大的超级树，有趣的阿凡达树。无论是白天看还是晚上看都非常有趣。在晚上还有音乐灯光表演，一晚上有两场。夜晚的超级树是很漂亮的，灯光闪烁，璀璨迷人。此时，上到空中廊桥是最好的，不但能够近距离看到树木的夜景，还能够从最好的角度拍摄金沙酒店的背面。总体游玩感觉很赞的，是非常值得一去的。,15/10/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-89924710?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

谢大人,5.0,新加坡被誉为&ldquo;花园城市&rdquo;果然名副其实，这次旅行深有体会，而对滨海湾花园尤为印象深刻。地理位置离金沙酒店很近，也可从bayfront站出来根据标示很容易找到。整个花园很大，远远就能看到宛若阿凡达世界里的supertree，到了晚上，这些&ldquo;参天大树&rdquo;会亮起映衬夜色的灯光，并且在指定时间开始震撼的音乐灯光秀。另外，我们去了两个室内冷气玻璃花园，分别叫cloud forest 和flower dome，室内冷气十足，一边感受着阳光透过玻璃落下来，一边吹着强冷气，很特别的体验。cloud forest主要亮点是从人造山和植物间倾泻而下的巨大瀑布，据说是世界最高的室内瀑布，很有气势。室内两条空中走廊，可以近距离观赏瀑布和拍照。flower dome 是以热带花卉和植物为主，其中不乏可爱的元素点缀，适合拍照。在supertree周围有一条空中走廊，需要另买票，分批放行游客乘电梯上去体验。走上去能感觉到轻微晃动，但视野很棒，能看到摩天轮和金沙。到了晚上，大量游客会选择supertree周围的空地上坐下等待灯光秀，第一场是七点四十五开始。灯光和音乐相互衬托制造了一场非常浪漫的show，好像到了童话世界。,06/10/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-161394118?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

Orliiii,5.0,新加坡知名的景點，與金沙酒店相對，走路距離大概20分，整個園區廣大，是填海造陸來的，其中最有名的就是天空樹、還有兩個溫室的巨蛋，園裡各類植物茂密，步道規劃的很好，像是一個超級巨大的公園，天空樹在晚上的時候會有燈光秀，而且在將近樹冠層的地方還建有步道，可以居高臨下看遍整個濱海灣，開闊又景色怡人，處處都是拍照景點，如果覺得徒步太累，可以從金沙酒店搭園內接駁車到兩個巨蛋前，不過這個是要付費的。建議可以先到金沙酒店的購物中心逛逛、再到樓上的酒吧喝一杯調酒看夕陽，之後再走去濱海灣，那時候不會那麼熱，然後可以待到晚上他的燈光秀之後再回去，吃個晚餐回去酒店時間剛剛好！,26/10/2022,1,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-173325801?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

没有蜡olling,5.0,又一年在赤道上的圣诞节，每年的滨海湾花园都有圣诞的特别装饰活动，今年第一时间也去看了。灯光还是很美的，相机基本上很难拍出来，但现场的灯海超级梦幻～ 本来是想等人工降雪，但下雪并没有固定的时间区间，只能凭运气，我们在场的那半个多小时没有等到只能离开了，有点遗憾。因为限流所以每个点工作人员都会一直催促你往前走，而且全程不允许窄下口罩，拍照真的有点难，所以这次基本上都拍景了。需要注意的是拍东西一定要快准狠，整个展区是不允许走回头路的只能一直往前，再加上工作人员的催促所以就是一路在慌乱的拍～体验有点不太好,08/02/2021,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/gardens-by-the-bay-94795-165693593?locale=en-SG,Garden by the bay

MsSophieYan,4.0,滨海湾金沙酒店10 Bayfront Avenue金沙酒店几乎成为每一个去新加坡旅游的人住宿的首选，因其特别有感觉的无边泳池而闻名于世。接待的客人也不计其数，而且服务态度都不错，各方面都还是有很棒的体验！酒店配备的服务人员大部分都会说中文，所有人都会说英文，所以完全不用担心语言交流问题。有任何问题都可以拨打客房服务，他们的态度还都很好！我住的是园景房，因为之前在别的宾馆住过海景房了，感觉能看到滨海湾花园还是很不错的。阳台的窗帘是全自动的，只要进入房间，通电以后就会自动打开，然后阳台上有很多花花草草的非常大自然的感觉。抽屉里配备的都是TWG的茶包，要泡茶喝咖啡也很方便。我比较喜欢它们的浴室装扮，那个色调倒是有点特别的美感。还有就是电视柜下的毛巾装置，很可爱很讨人喜欢。,23/12/2018,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-157497020?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands

joyce1616,4.0,在新加坡的最后一晚住在金沙酒店，就是为了体验一下57楼的无边泳池，先前住在丽思卡尔顿，金沙与之相比，大堂人很多，很嘈杂，房间小了不说，设施也差，浴巾很糙，洗发沐浴产品很普通，服务也差，check in时一脸看不起的样子，也许是携程订的房间，开始只肯给4楼的面对滨海湾花园的房间，还说已经没房间了，要知道我是提早三个月就订的至尊房，据理力争才给了22楼面对滨海湾花园的，新加坡正好雾霾，据说要到明年一月才会有蓝天，所以57层还是等到晚上看夜景，走到酒吧观景台才觉得好，俯瞰整个滨海湾，真得很漂亮，不过前几日住在丽思卡尔顿每晚&yen;1600也是正对整个滨海湾，天天躺在浴缸里就能看到无敌海景，性价比高得多！前三张照片是坐在泳池边拍的，后面几张是在57楼酒吧的阳台拍的，那里才能俯瞰，要不就是拿着相机到泳池里才拍得到。到酒吧拍照不用消费的！,04/11/2015,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-59819144?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands

考拉羊洋,5.0,"KOMA Singapore是新晋的网红日本料理店，位于新加坡的金沙酒店商场内，门口一排大红色的鸟居像极了伏见稻荷大社，十分吸引眼球。之前一直路过，今天终于进来体验了一次这高颜值的日式美食。通过正门约20米的长廊，就来到吧台区，吧台内挂着一个2.5米高的巨大铜钟，横跨吧台和主用餐区，非常有气势。吧台后面就是用餐区，空间很大，还有一个日式的小桥架在餐厅内，超有代入感。食物方面是主厨的一些原创菜品为特色，包括前菜小食和主食，最后还有甜品和各种酒类。前菜类我们点了Wagyu Beef Tataki日式生牛肉冷盘，选用的牛肉非常鲜嫩，口感细滑十分开胃。Oysters on the half shell则是新鲜的生蚝，配上些许小萝卜泥，也是非常鲜美。寿司类的选择很多，Truffle Unagi的黑松露味很浓，搭配鳗鱼的甜香很是特别。Spicy Hamachi是脆皮葱寿司裹着芝麻子。还有Spicy Tuna、Lobster &amp; Caviar等共十种选择。除了寿司，各种日式锅和炒饭也是餐厅的特色。Wagyu fried rice中的牛肉粒很嫩，入口即化，不过份量不算很大，性价比稍微低了一点。而几款日式和牛更是价格不菲，每份都超过200新，也是吓得我们立马转移目光。鸡尾酒里KOMA Canary和Sheares in Love是推荐，而甜品Jumbo Sesame profiterole份量倒是大的惊人，而且冰淇凌配上黑芝麻做的面包，口感非常棒。建议提前在官网预定座位，用餐当天餐厅也会打电话来确认预定人数和时间，可谓相当用心。店名：KOMA Singapore。地址：Marina Bay Sands, 2 Bayfront Ave, B1-67, 新加坡 018972。",09/09/2019,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-160854577?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands

VV云云,4.0,新加坡金沙酒店。这个酒店以其独特的建筑外形闻名世界，而空中泳池是大家慕名而来的主要原因之一。我的确是这样理解的，这个泳池的门票（酒店房票）还真是贵价。2000多元的房间，居然连个浴缸都没有，吃个早餐还要排长龙，也太黑了。但说到楼顶的无边泳池，真是正到无得弹。由于暴雨，我们足足等了一个小时才能下水，但玩得很尽兴。最大的收获，莫过于小土孩第一次能穿着救生衣独自游泳了。从一定要拖着大人的手，到敢放开手自己划水，一下子觉得他勇敢不少。在这里，是有钱人的天堂，什么奢侈品牌都有，而我们只有看的份，很多店铺连入的勇气都没有。至于特色手信，还是推荐新加坡本土品牌TWG，虽然在国内也有专卖店，但在新加坡买品种较多，还有这里专有的品种，如singapore breakfast tea,07/03/2018,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-153745418?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands

紫澄爱旅行,0.0,落日金辉下的金沙到新加坡旅行，可以选择搭乘水陆两栖鸭子船，先是静静地在城市中穿行，然后在海湾中欣赏落日余晖。此时，落日余晖下的金沙酒店，玻璃幕墙上倒映着金色的光芒，仿佛在向远航的船只指引归途！狮城之旅，就在这样的惬意时光中悄然开启。,26/07/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-160344586?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands
Go旅城通票,0.0,新加坡的经济发展几十年来一直势头强劲，人均 GDP 稳居世界前十。即使历经几次经济危机的冲击，也总能快速恢复到正常水平。&ldquo;国运&rdquo;可以说是数一数二的了。今天就带大家走遍新加坡最繁华的街区  ，看看新加坡人是如何巧妙利用风水的玄妙，揽尽天下钱财 。 新达城新加坡最知名的&ldquo;风水地标&rdquo;就是香港富豪李嘉诚在这里投资的新达城了。新达城的五座大楼成环绕状，一矮四高，形似左手的五根手指。而&ldquo;手掌&rdquo;中间的喷泉更是内有玄机。一般的喷泉都是从上到下，从内向外喷洒。新达城的这座喷泉却是由四根青铜柱合力举起一个圆环，让水从圆环内侧自上而下，由外向内汇聚。据说向内汇聚的喷泉水象征了财富从四面八方向新达城汇聚。因此这座喷泉也被称为&ldquo;财富之泉&rdquo;。 滨海艺术中心 据非官方民间传闻，由于新达城的&ldquo;手掌&rdquo;正好朝向新加坡金融区，会吸走新加坡的&ldquo;财气&rdquo;。为了抵挡新达城的风水局，新加坡政府特地将滨海艺术中心修建成榴莲的形状。如此一来，当&ldquo;手掌&rdquo;试图抓取金融区的财运时，就会被榴莲的尖角刺伤，保住了新加坡的财运。 滨海湾金沙 无独有偶，滨海湾金沙也修建了一个由外向内流的漩涡瀑布，跟新达城的&ldquo;财富之泉&rdquo;有着异曲同工之妙。金沙酒店的造型酷似三座大山，酒店顶层的无边泳池则寓意大山顶峰的一弯湖水。风水师认为这能让金沙酒店与周围的环境保持和谐，让财富生生不息。 新加坡摩天轮 不远处的新加坡摩天轮是这里的另一个网红地标。在摩天轮的 28 颗胶囊舱上欣赏新加坡的风光，是游客来到这里必打卡的选项。新加坡摩天轮刚开始运行的时候是朝逆时针方向旋转的，后来才变成现在的顺时针。据说这是在风水师的建议下进行的调整。让摩天轮成为新加坡的&ldquo;风水轮&rdquo;，为新加坡带来源源不断的好运气。中国风水自久前就已经写进新加坡的基因中，为这座傲立在亚欧大陆南端的小岛，增添了不少风格独具的建筑和趣味横生的市井逸闻。也许生活的真谛，就是在无尽的相生相克中，感受最灿烂  多姿的世界。,28/01/2021,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-166969991?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands
遇见狮城,0.0,来新加坡旅行，必去金沙购物中心。这里不仅是新加坡的地标，也是游客们到此采购的好地方。在这里，有超过300多家的店铺，让你逛到腿软。逛累了，找个地方歇歇脚，亦或是只为了和朋友坐下来聊聊天，TWG或许是很好的选择。TWG TEA于2008年诞生于新加坡，它虽然没有悠久的历史背景，但却只用了7年时间，就把店铺开遍了纽约、伦敦、东京、上海等29个国家，现在它已经毋庸置疑地成为茶品牌中的奢侈品。说到&ldquo;茶文化&rdquo;，第一个一定会想到中国，如果再往下说可能就是英国和日本了，估计很少有人会通过&ldquo;茶文化&rdquo;想到美国和摩洛哥这两个国家，但正是来自摩洛哥的Taha和来自美国的Maranda Barnes创立了一个世界顶级的&ldquo;茶&rdquo;品牌&mdash;&mdash;TWG TEA。今天我们并不想和大家探讨这个茶到底好不好喝，值不值那么多钱，毕竟萝卜青菜各有所爱。但如果你是来新加坡旅行，不知道带什么礼物送朋友，我觉得TWG的茶也未尝不是一种选择，在新加坡伴手礼中它也有着重要的位置。一盒15小包的茶，$26。当然在这里享受一个悠闲的下午茶时光也是不错的。说一下，我们的感受吧：这里的环境不用多说了，看图体会。Rum baba：不太甜的香草冰淇淋搭配着朗姆酒果冻和浸在酒、糖稀的蛋糕，蛋糕有些甜，搭配周围的无糖淡奶油反倒起到了解腻的口感，整体上很满足一个小酒鬼的甜品需求。$13++strawberry vacherin：新鲜的草莓，搭配了冰淇淋，底层用半个并不齁甜的翻糖蛋糕做支撑，既有糖的甜味，又中和了新鲜草莓丝丝的酸味，恰到好处。$13++两杯茶：一杯是sexy tea，红茶系列，闻起来很香，除了茶叶本身的清香，还掺杂着一丝丝的果香甜蜜感；另一杯是secret tea，绿茶系列。依然是可以闻到茶叶的清香，入口后是有一丝回甘的。两种茶都是$11/壶，不可以续水如果一定说这里的不好，就是有时需要排长队其实有时在旅行中，未必矫情那个东西是否好吃、好喝，更多的是我们多了一份好心情，多了一种新体验，多了一幕美好的回忆虽然，我们生活在这里，但我们一样去探秘生活中的美好，去体会人生中的乐趣最后，小伙伴买了一盒薄荷茶按她的话讲&ldquo;那个茶，就一个词，绝，打开茶包的包装，一股薄荷的清香扑鼻而来，学习办公的时候泡上一壶，房间充满了薄荷香，神清气爽，元气满满&rdquo;坐标新加坡金沙关注我们，带你玩转不一样的新加坡#网红店##新加坡旅游# #新加坡美食# #新加坡探店# #新加坡印象# #新加坡甜品#,26/10/2020,12,https://sg.trip.com/review/marina-bay-sands-10354609-164288484?locale=en-SG,Marina Bay Sands

Tried taxi twice only from changi to hotel flat rate $60 (single trip)2. Singapore is kid and stroller friendly! lift accessible almost everywhere3. Hot and humid. You need plenty water to drink. sometimes got exhausted, better not to squeeze your itinerary to much in a single day. also, i bought a neck fan. helped me cool off during hot day.4. MRT ezlink pass, when about to return back to your country, if you still have balance. you can spend to buy at the 7eleven or cash refunded at some selected mrt stations. 5. When ordering food, especially at hawker centre, dont expect them to say &ldquo;hi sir/mam, how are you, thank you, or even smile&rdquo; speed is more important than hospitality, considering when its busy lunch time6. what a Clean city! make sure you dont litter as well7. You get lost, do not hesitate to ask. People are friendly enough to help you (my experience)8. Escalator in singapore is kinda quick. be careful (my mom almost fell once lol 😅) 9. Garden of the bay and marina bay both are full day experience. dont forget watch garden rhapsody light show and within walking distance, you need to watch &lsquo;spectra&rsquo; (light water show) at marina bay after. check the schedule time. YOu Must watch both! they re so amazing!10.

Su StoneMountain,5.0,"My favourite attraction in Singapore. Love this place whether I&rsquo;m with friends, little children, as a couple, family or own my own. Incredibly well laid out. Take it at your own pace, read as much as you want of the phenomenal amount of info on display or just meander along taking in the beauty of the aquariums, the enclosures the pools etc. I absolutely love the boat ride especially when it&rsquo;s not busy and you can go around multiple times. Lots of people think this is just aquatic life and they would be wrong. I love the pandas, the red ones especially and on the boat ride if you&rsquo;re lucky you can see the big cats and lots of other mammals, anteaters and monkeys as easy to spot.",22/08/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/river-wonders-98700-178547289?locale=en-SG,River Wonder

capitano,5.0,リバーサファリとなっているが、今はリバーワンダーズ(River Wonders)に名称が変わってます。入場券を予約していたが、入場券を引き換えてもらう場所は隣のシンガポール動物園(Singapore Zoo)のチケットセンターになる。川のテーマパークだが、ここでのメインは個人的には割と近くでゆっくりパンダが見れます。,22/02/2023,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/river-wonders-98700-174984490?locale=en-SG,River Wonder
山水人生,5.0,河川生态园游览是去年才开业的景区，依托新加坡最大的蓄水库和附近茂密的树林，以世界上著名的河流为主题，对河流区域内的动物、植物进行相应的介绍。图文并茂再加上一些活生生的动植物，这样的游览方式也是一种创新。我们沿着参观通道从密西西比河流域展区开始起步，在观赏和学习中走过刚果河、尼罗河、恒河、玛丽河、湄公河和中国的长江等河流，看到各地的风情照片和代表性动物，还有大幅的地方风情照片，其中就有我们一个多月前才去过的印度瓦拉纳西恒河之畔。除了看到游览通道两侧的观景鱼池里养殖的各河流域特色鱼类外，我们还通过文字介绍，知道了密西西比河是世界上最蜿蜒曲折的河流；知道了刚果河是世界上最深的河流；还知道了湄公河是&ldquo;众河之母&rdquo;。世界上的河流成千上万，能够认识这些各具特色的河流也是一种幸运。这个生态园除了让游客看到罕见的动植物，还能够增加丰富很多河流区域的知识，这也是旅游中不多见的人文与自然结合的景区。在这里看到一群小学生在老师的带领下来此游览，孩子们在触摸池旁亲手抚摸海星等鱼类动物时的兴奋表情，可以感受到如此的体验将深刻地烙印在他们幼小的脑海中。到新加坡还不到48小时，在多处旅游景点看到小学生和幼儿园孩子们的身影，对新加坡儿童的幸福生活有了更直观的体会和思考。真是幸福的童年。,17/12/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/river-wonders-98700-93234821?locale=en-SG,River Wonder

Although we didn&#39;t get to see Le Le but at least we managed to see her via the TV.Overall, it is a nice place to visit to have some good family time. #riverwonders #panda #staycation",30/05/2022,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/river-wonders-98700-171212457?locale=en-SG,River Wonder

It showcases exotic &amp; weird creatures/wildlife from 8 different prominent Rivers/Forests from all over the world, including the mighty Amazon. Many of these Amazing Creatures seen here cannot be found in any aquariums. So there is UNDOUBTEDLY a huge difference between River Safari &amp; S.E.A Aquarium! Here you see at &#39;close up view&#39; - a number of deep sea &quot;ancient creatures &amp; weird looking monsters.&quot; Including the Giant Pandas. One usually gets to see such exotic creatures only on TV documentaries, as they are found in deep rivers or forests. The huge Amazon Piranhas are really awesome. Have seen piranhas in other aquariums but not this Huge! Piranhas has an awesome reputation &amp; nothing beats seeing a whole school of Huge piranhas this close staring at you when you get close- just a few inches away separated by a thick glass. How many people in their lifetime can or will the opportunity to go to the great Amazon River/Forests to see these amazing killers? Or even to the other rivers/forest?

ell***lt,5.0,夜间动物园要不要去，犹豫了好久，网上太多吐槽了，但实际体验下来，觉得很有趣！值得打卡！暑假排小火车的人是很多，对于我们先去走徒步路线啦，人不多也不少正合适（人太少也会有点点恐惧的感觉），虽然天很黑，动物真的是要很仔细才能辨别，但不妨碍我们觉得在夜间徒步动物园超有意思。整个路线走了快2小时，娃走得太认真啦，一个也不肯放过，中间在休息站喝饮料稍微耽误了15分钟，最有趣的是途中遇到饲养员就在路边给小袋鼠喂食，好可爱哦。最后出来再坐的小火车，9:45以后基本就不怎么排队了，坐火车能看到一些徒步看不到的动物，火车30分钟。来夜间动物园还是要徒步，更有体验感，然后最大的考验是体力，一天逛2个园子太累了，可是这里足足有4个动物园，得建个度假村才行。旁边现在确实是工地，不知道以后会不会有新的变化，22:30出园后走去打车，也排队了好久，特种兵的一天。,24/08/2023,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-178571794?locale=en-SG,Safari

M52***01,5.0,夜间动物园的争议比较大，这里我说点比较客观的评价，如果你是喜欢新奇事物，爱探险的那种人，来这里就对了；如果你是比较保守的那种类型，对于新事物没有太多好奇心，那这里可能对你是个大坑。因为这次是跟父母一起去，我觉得非常爽，很有沉浸感，晚上步行看动物非常的有氛围，然而我父母觉得很无聊，晚上漆黑嘛乌的看不清楚，觉得还不如去国内的动物园。所以这里要不要去，一定要根据性格来，切记！,02/10/2023,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-179221211?locale=en-SG,Safari

外星人,4.0,夜间动物园是此行的最大亮点，第一次在夜里去看动物，很考验眼力，很多有趣的动物需要步行才能看的到，这种体验感是以前没有过的，建议来新加坡的人一定要来体验一下。这里要着重说一下少给一颗星的原因，是公园的入园管理太过于混乱，订的7点45的票，7点半就到了大门口，排着长长的队，问了前面人也是同样时间，快排到了才发现前面很多人都是后面的时间，于是经过允许带家人走到最前面，又到了下一个排队处，这时候已经快8点了，可是前面另一处入园口却卡着不放入园，8点整才放，我后来觉得他们应该是排的8点的队，但是全程也没有任何提示。等8点入园后紧赶慢赶的赶到中文小火车，被告知预定的8点的小火车已经走了，也不能改签，也不能退票，只能靠步行了，虽然后来感到由于步行反而体验到了很多不一样的，但是前面这波入园的体验真的让人很失望，建议园方不要设置各个不同入园时间，设置了也请提示到位或者在入园处按入园时间设置不同通道，否则大家都排一起，谁知道前面的人都是几点入场呢，耽误了后面行程直接影响到游玩心情，游客一定一定要早到，建议直接到最前面问现在排的是几点的队，否则耽误自己的事儿！,07/10/2023,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-179285876?locale=en-SG,Safari

我是大老黑,5.0,如果你很喜欢city walk这类的活动，并且有可以顺便看看动物的话，夜间动物园是你的最佳选择。由于我的航班晚点造成的形成时间紧凑，我带孩子到了动物园已经将近晚上9点半了，但是票已经是提前预定好不能退的，没有办法还是去看看。因为是直接从机场提着箱子去的动物园，又带着娃，所以直接坐了游览小火车。而我们预定的中文班次已经错过了预定时间没有了。所以全程坐小火车游览下来，我认为夜间游览动物园其实徒步会更有乐趣，新加坡动物园里面非常干净，并且没有任何异味，这点非常赞。沿途的风景也是东南亚的各种植物，布景也非常美，真的能让你感受到每一处的用心设计。所以在夜间动物园更多的是享受漫步在雨林里的心情。至于中文小火车的建议，就一定要按照你预定时间去，如果错过，就只能乘坐英文解说的小火车，因为还有很多没见过的动物，所以基本上你是不知道在说什么的，只能滑溜一下眼珠子。如果带小朋友的话可以顺便乘坐，如果特意只为了这一项也没有必要特意去一趟，还是三大动物园连起来玩一圈会比较有乐趣，因为都是在同一个区域，进出都很方便。希望我的经历可以帮到大家。,13/09/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-178964543?locale=en-SG,Safari
我是大老黑,5.0,由于是首次去新加坡玩，全程的机票酒店+门票都是通过携程上预定，所以并没有研究具体路线，只是预订了我觉得好玩并且可以带小朋友让他感兴趣的地方，其中一个就是夜间动物园。去浏览了一圈之后，我还是建议大家白天去三大动物园。这三大动物园都是在同一个区域，并且占地很大，有同一天的通票，主题分别是&ldquo;鸟的天堂&rdquo;&ldquo;河川动物园&rdquo;&ldquo;新加坡动物园&rdquo;。具体里面能看到什么动物就请大家自行攻略看下自己感兴趣的，再决定要不要去就好。如果都想去的话，一天是可以玩完的。夜间动物园主要就是个新鲜感，可能会让小朋友记忆犹新，但是对成人来我个人观点，并没有什么看头。首先晚上灯光昏暗，如果你真的想去动物园的话还是白天看的比较清楚。其次是如果你坐小火车并且英文不好的话，你是完全听不懂讲解的，单独的中文班次小火车只在特定时间，需要提前在携程预订。还有就是新加坡法律非常严格，在携程预订的好处就是如果条款写的让你困惑，你可以第一时间咨询人工客服，他们会帮你确认好你的疑惑和顾虑，这点真的很赞。并且我对比过自己去其他途径或者官网去预定相关景点门票，发现价格差别不大，甚至携程上的价格有时候会更有优势，并且有人工客服可以沟通。希望对大家有帮助！,13/09/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-178964449?locale=en-SG,Safari

玥亮,5.0,新加坡夜间动物园是世界上首家夜间开放（19点到24点）的动物园，园区规划了两种游园方式，游览专车行径路线3.2公里，大约45分钟，沿途可看到凶猛的大型动物，如花豹、野牛、羚羊以及懒猴、眼镜猴等。如果看不过瘾，园区另外规划了渔猫小径、花豹小径和森林小径共2.8公里的步道，可慢慢探访夜色笼罩下的丛林景象。简直是一次非常惊险刺激的旅行，马来貘随时可以上车和你同游，袋鼠就在你面前跳跃，头顶不知何时飞过何种动物，热带雨林里下着雨，观赏夜间动物的夜行活动，意义非常&hellip;&hellip;,13/06/2017,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-109870333?locale=en-SG,Safari
山水人生,5.0,07:15在夜幕尚未完全降临之际，夜间动物园开门营业，游客都是凭指定时间的入场券进场。因为急着搭乘有限的游览车，因此排队的游客就很多，而且进入后也都是蜂拥前往搭乘游览车的车站。我们因为是已经预约了后续的中文游览车，因此也就没有必要去凑那个热闹。我们依据夜间动物园的简介提示，初步排定了今晚在此的游览程序，检票入场后直接奔动物表演露天剧院，观看07:30的第一场表演。半圆形的露天剧场座位不少，观看的游客也很多，但整个表演却很一般，出场的动物表演的基本都是很低智商的动作。再加上主持人说英语我们也听不懂，因此很多内容也就无法体会。表演中主持人还不断地请观众上场互动，其实看起来就是在拖延时间，而且所谓的观众最后一位玩蟒蛇的那位，看起来明显就是工作人员扮演的。结束约25分钟的动物表演观看，我们又步行到徒步游览区，这里的游客与搭乘游览车的相比绝对是寥寥无几。在这座号称&ldquo;世界上第一个专为夜间动物设置的动物园&rdquo;内，有好几条丛林小径供游客漫步，但愿意投身黑暗的大自然中的游客显然不多。我们沿着昏暗灯光下的丛林小径，在提心吊胆中走了一段，看到非常有限的动物和最大发挥的动物介绍。感觉这样黑灯瞎火的步行游览，提心吊胆似乎是一种心理折磨，于是放弃了再走一段的打算，提前约20分钟抵达搭乘中文讲解游览车的站台。我们搭乘的08:45这班游览车空空荡荡只坐了连我们在内的八位游客，一圈40分钟游下来，沿途也确实看到一些动物，有老虎、大象、狮子、豹子和鹿等等。在昏暗的灯光下这些圈养的动物只能让我们看到个轮廓，而且也许是晚上再加上圈养的缘故，这些动物基本都是懒懒散散。倒是讲解员的讲解还让我们了解了一些知识，如果是搭乘英文导游的游览车，听不懂讲解那绝对是非常不值得的游览项目。,15/12/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-93193996?locale=en-SG,Safari

鱼小米hello,3.0,行河川生态园出来就去夜间动物园了 但是夜间动物园大概6点半才放客人进去 之前预约的7:15 7:45之类的其实根本没什么意义 当天去就可以 跟表演时间和小火车时间完全无关。排队进去后 两个选择：排队小火车或者排队看表演。我们选择小火车。又是漫长的等待 7:00小火车开。我很建议说马上排小火车 因为第一趟或者第二趟上小火车的乘客 可以趁着落日前 看到一些动物 不然黑天了 真是什么都看不到了。我们是第二趟小火车 7:05发车 然后7:35游览回来 7:20左右就很黑了 基本听听讲解就可以了。动物园人很多 孩子也很累了 我们直接回圣淘沙酒店 这样到酒店都10点了。所以想带小朋友去夜间动物园 一定要住在市区&hellip;,09/04/2023,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-175456788?locale=en-SG,Safari
无非子,5.0,夜间动物园必须要买中文小火车，即使你没换到19:15的入场券，也可根据预定的中文火车的时间从旁边乘坐小火车的侧门进去。不然的话入大门要等，里面的免费小火车也要等，这前等后等估计没个3小时是搞不定的。19:00先大门口看一场土著喷火表演，接着直接拿火车票去侧面排队（我预约了19:45的中文小火车，所谓的中文小火车就是火车上有可调节的语言解说），时间刚刚好。夜间动物园除了坐火车听讲解外，还可以自己步行小径去找动物，和另外两个动物演出。由于孩子们都累了，乘好火车就直接打道回府了。虽然游览时间不长，但还是看到了不少动物，尤其是上次没看到的长颈鹿（宝对长颈鹿有着莫名的执念，到哪动物园都得找它，上次没找到这次圆了）。还看到了马来西亚的土著物种马来貘，圆滚滚的一头，有猪的既视感，又有点像象，但人家可是跟犀牛和马是近亲。,02/08/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-117097532?locale=en-SG,Safari

多啦丘丘,4.0,一直听闻新加坡夜间动物园很神奇，所以三刷新加坡的时候，前两次都没去的动物园，成了首选之地想象中夜间动物园应该是很神秘很热闹的样子，然而神秘归神秘，热闹一点不足，神奇动物也不知道在哪里？最要命的是，为了不打扰动物的习性，整个园区的灯光调的非常之暗。不知道是让我们看👀动物，还是让动物看👀我们如果不是靠着游览车的中文解说，昏暗的灯光里有些动物真的超难被看到。感觉我们眼都要看瞎了，分分钟把大石头当成大河马来处理😅手机渣画质拍出来都是糊的这么幽暗的环境里，倒是很适合播放起恐怖音乐，恶作剧人吓人的😱我才不会告诉你我就是这么干的🤪只有剧场表演时间，才能看清小动物的机灵，也难为它们一天要开三场OT，来满足人类的好奇心这个晚上的夜间动物园NIGHT SAFARI，本来我还想大力推荐的，去完之后就不那么想了😂,15/05/2021,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-166561736?locale=en-SG,Safari
紫豆,5.0,没有想到的是到了新加坡，动物园居然成了必游项目，可以买四园联票，都值得去。夜晚的动物园7：15开始入园，需要提前到日间动物园门口排队选入场场次，8：15和9：15最为抢手，为了减少等待的焦虑，园外还有演出。动物园漆黑幽静，参天大树下凉风习习，夜间出行的动物们活跃起来了，很是不一样的体验。如果说不足，那就是9：15的场次出来几乎所以公交系统都停运了，回城里有点儿费劲，只能打车。,18/07/2019,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-159808950?locale=en-SG,Safari

人在旅途不减肥,4.0,清迈的时候去过，印象里就是动物很傻，也不动就在灯光下。本来只打算去河川，娃非常想去啊，所以我们分了两天去了，主要是当天从河川出来买当天票，已经没有了。所以票要提前买的。交通：河川和动物园都离那么远，现在的物价，当然是选地铁！1⃣️坐地铁，红线坐到Khatib，到站后下车A口出门左拐，往前200米即到班车站2⃣️坐班车：A口左拐出来会有些不同的车站，我们清明节去的，还有好多去扫墓的班车呢。不要担心和迷糊，就直接找找看看哪个是去动物园的就好哦。3⃣️票价：班车可以刷地铁卡，1新币/人4⃣️购票及预约：参观时间：因为是夜间动物园咯，19:30才开始，但是可以早点来的啦。门票购买：携程，直接出电子票，我也确实看到老外打印的票进的。5⃣️Night safari表演预约：官网预约，也不麻烦。我打算先看第一场表演，再坐小火车，不然太晚回去。这个表演挺被称赞的，但是其实和很多海洋馆、动物园的动物表演没有区别呀，一个故事背景而已，动物是小工具。6⃣️小火车之旅：大晚上的徒步，会挺害怕的，所以就只做了小火车。没想到，整个night safari的这个沉浸感和参与感是小火车的司机给的。,12/07/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-177560977?locale=en-SG,Safari

萍萍洋洋99,3.0,夜间动物园号称是世界动物园中的爱马仕。通过携程预定会便宜一些，现场的门票是55成人，通过携程预定大概折合51.6新币，但是手续相对麻烦，预定成功之后会给你一个九位数的预定单号，游客需要用着酒味的预订单码登录夜间动物园的网址进行预约，预约网址不是很nice，会出现预约不上或者与记录不一致的情况。夜间动物园有三个项目&middot;19:30有一个动物表演，整体动物表演没有高潮，平铺直叙，时间30分钟左右。第二个项目是看完演出出来坐电瓶车游览夜间动物园，这个项目真的是体验非常好，但是建议一定要带清楚的望远镜，因为夜间视线不是很好看的，并不是特别的清楚，但是很魔幻，很漂亮。巨大的食蚁兽离你脚边只有半米远，真的是超级魔幻，两头巨大的狮子在忽明忽暗魔幻的灯光下显得尤其的漂亮，第三个项目是步行游览参观动物，如果有体力和精力的话，建议步行也感受一下，在路口的转角与狮子王不期而遇，简直是人生莫大的愉快体验。,28/04/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-175647766?locale=en-SG,Safari

kevinready1,2.0,严重缩水！性价比超低！我们于2017年来过&ldquo;夜间动物园&rdquo;，当时觉得小火车还行，就是时间短。今年8月26日带二娃来，对比之后，太&ldquo;水&rdquo;了。首先，动物少的可伶，记得好像就十几个园区，&ldquo;老虎&rdquo;，狼，一概没有，连长颈鹿等都没有看到！记得2017年时，当时有很多老虎，狮子等食肉动物。火车行程最后1/3经过的都是围挡，估计就是原来的动物园区，现在啥也没有！总之，一车人都感觉&ldquo;太水&rdquo;了，娃很失望，来之前非常期待，最终草草结束。,27/08/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-178611106?locale=en-SG,Safari

树崽,5.0,时间紧，任务重，临时决定，提前一天买到了票，随机出电子票，直接自助取票，不用打印，很方便快捷。只是以为新加坡很小，错误判断了去的时长，结果有史以来搭乘了60站公交车，坐了两个多小时。下午提前两小时先去逛了河川动物园，然后在夜间动物园门口一边吃饭一边看喷火表演，吃完刚好赶上入场时间。只是门票带的中文小火车时间有点长，7点15入场，8点才开始坐小火车，排队等了很久，不过看到小动物一切都是值得的。坐完小火车正好出口有节目表演，忍痛放弃了步行游览，去看动物表演。表演很温馨，还有垃圾分类的环保知识，只是全程英文，要是有字幕或者解说就好啦。看完节目10点啦，小朋友坚持不住了，我步行浏览计划彻底泡汤，回家！138公交车开到晚上12点15分，真好！,30/03/2018,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-154178315?locale=en-SG,Safari

_CF***31,5.0,第一站，夜间野生动物园，营业到晚上12点，世界上第一家夜间野生动物园。一下飞机直接打车急吼吼去夜间动物园，门票订的晚上7点15，不能错过时间。司机人不错，30分钟的路程20分钟抵达。预定的中文观光车，不用排队，也能听懂讲解。缆车穿梭于世界7个不同地理区域，从崎岖的喜马拉雅山脉到亚洲河区森林的沼泽河岸。讲真，夜间看不清楚动物，享受的是夜晚的神秘感。所幸动物们都还没睡觉，基本全都看到了。恩，夜间的丛林还是很吓人的，特别是没有灯光的地方。坐完缆车看表演，一只很萌的动物笑翻我，我行我素说来就来说走就走，毫不理睬主持人的呼唤。看完表演步行小径。4条小径走了2条，每条走了5分钟我就往回走了，因为，我怕了。是的，我怕了。因为第一条小径我进了一个山洞，隔着玻璃窗我在想怎么没有动物，等我反应过来是一条和树木颜色相近的蛇时，我瞬间就跑了。不死心，跑了第二条小径，暗搓搓的小路，暗搓搓的树木丛林，暗搓搓的红色灯光，我实在不想为难我自己，so，我逃了。我在想，以后去亚马逊热带雨林，看来我只能观赏白天的动物了，晚上的动物我hold不住啊。,09/09/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-121230879?locale=en-SG,Safari

bjdaye,5.0,"善心大发，致后来人：❶动物园分成7，8，9点一刻三个入园时间，建议7点一刻入园，早看早完，建议高峰假日提前2天网上购票，我在除夕前一天晚上已经买不到除夕7点的票了，携程票只能在夜间动物园的自助机上换，在日间动物园的自助机上换不了(虽然俩机器长的一样)；❷没有买到7点票也不要担心，我买的8点票，实际上工作人员会看园内火车排队情况放人进，注意听工作人员广播，当天7点25左右，广播8点票可以入园；❸默认票价包含英文广播小火车，如图中红色路线，大概乘车时间十五至二十分钟,车上每个座位前有3.5mm解说器耳机插孔，图示有标中文解说，但我没有耳机，无法确认，我旁边两个韩国人自带耳机选的韩语解说听，或每人加10新元可选中文广播小火车，但中文火车单独站台排队，车少人多，排队时间长，个人不建议(怎么看都是人傻钱多)；❹步行路线4条是首尾相连的(图示4种颜色)，一旦开始走，基本就会从头走到尾；❺火车动物和步行动物有重叠的地方，也有各自不同的，具体见图❻一些经典动物，比如渔猫在步行道1渔猫小径的入口不远处，步行道2花豹小径有leopard和飛天鼯鼠(真的飞了),都是只有步行可见，步行道34有啥不记得了；❼游览出园后，我乘坐的车上标有saex的白色大巴车，月台上白色柜台，当场购票，两条线路，每人6块，把酒店名告诉卖票的，他会把酒店名写到票上，上车把票给司机，他会安排每个人的线路直送酒店，我坐的时候50人金龙大巴，只做了10个人就开了，貌似是定点发车，最晚一趟到23点，车上冷，自备衣服。❽夜间zoo整体上不如日间zoo，管理稍混乱，但依然是全地球最高水准，甩我万生园十条街不止，另外个人认为步行比火车有意思，但依然建议先火车再步行，整体耗时2小时多一点。❾快给好评，谢谢",16/02/2018,1,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-153326980?locale=en-SG,Safari

小不点,4.0,飞禽公园出来后直接去了夜间动物园，这是此次所有行程中唯一排队等待入园的，可见火爆程度。在等待入园时我们没有随人流排队等待开园，而是在园内的餐厅边吃晚餐边等待入园。开园前会有段现场秀，4个猛男表演火把秀。入园后继续排队等待乘小火车，因禁止用闪光灯拍照，所以没拍。在这就不剧透了，蛮有新鲜感的，带娃的话建议一游。开园时间：19:30-24:00分3个时间段入园：19:30、20:30、21:30,28/02/2016,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-84217811?locale=en-SG,Safari

M19***70,5.0,最大的感受是至少躲开了白天的炙热阳光。能看到不少动物。可以先提前网购买门票，到服务台换票预约进园时间。有个技巧：可以选择购买中文小火车，耳机讲解，这样就可以提前进园走走4条连成内环的步行道，择时再看动物表演，过后直接乘坐中文小火车走外环道。,23/08/2019,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-160556705?locale=en-SG,Safari
探索大自然,5.0,新加坡夜间动物是亚洲首个夜间动物园，里面的动物很多。最有趣的是有免费的小列车载着游客近距离观看动物，沿途会看到不同的各种动物，大象特别大，比普通的大象还大，不知道是哪种品种。还有动物表演等等，非常有趣。,11/07/2019,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-159696844?locale=en-SG,Safari
juki235,5.0,新加坡有两座动物园，一间是白天开放的，而这间是在夜间开放的。他是全亚洲最好的夜间动物园之一，不仅可以看到许多在白天不出来的夜行动物，还可以欣赏精彩的动物表演，寓教于乐十分的好玩，绝对值得带小朋友来游玩一次。,11/06/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-159262249?locale=en-SG,Safari
bobo,5.0,本次夜间动物园探险家之旅，还是非常不错的，预定&ldquo;探险家之旅&rdquo;后，不需要再预定大门票及园内小火车，我们会有专属的小车及工作人员陪同我们游览夜间动物园，中途并且会有机会下车喂大象，我们主要带着孩子游玩，孩子非常开心，以后有机会还会选择！,22/02/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157978193?locale=en-SG,Safari
_We***67,5.0,一定要定中文小火车，中文小火车其实是优先快捷票，不管几点的门票都可以提前进场，所谓的中文就是耳机里面的解说选中文，一共有三节车厢，最好坐在前面两个车厢，第一个车厢里会有工作人员，找不到动物可以帮指一下，第二个车厢视角比较好，最后一个听解说的时候看不太到动物，走的时候才能看到，携程订的小火车是第一批，感觉真的不错哎，对于带孩子来的人来说，能早开始真的很重要，我们回到宾馆已经十点半多了,01/02/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157749121?locale=en-SG,Safari
_We***67,5.0,夜间动物园真的值得一去，除了小火车自己走走各种小径感觉也很好，能够自己找到夜色里的动物也很有意思，不过夜间动物园对于小孩子来说有点儿晚了，所以要定最早一班七点半的中文小火车，小火车大概五十分钟，就算这样没怎么看表演到酒店也已经十点半，孩子躺床上就睡了，所以还是尽早吧,01/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157748768?locale=en-SG,Safari
_We***11,5.0,从白天逛到天黑，这里是亚洲唯一一个只在夜间开放的动物园。这里的乐趣不在于看动物，而在于在乌漆麻黑中找动物。[偷笑]幽暗的灯光中，我们努力分辨着动物在哪里，是什么，时不时还会听见各种嚎叫，完全满足了孩子对野外丛林的好奇心！,25/11/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157291486?locale=en-SG,Safari
M32***20,5.0,夜间动物园真不错，坐着小火车就把动物都看了一遍了，省劲多了，也不累。下午逛完日间动物园，门口吃完饭转到夜间动物园的。怕不让早进去，特地买的19:15的票，其实没必要，因为买了中文小火车是19:45的票，所以，不管大门票是几点你都可以提前进去的。19点进去的，先看了19:15的夜间精灵表演，听不懂英文，也没看明白表演的是啥意思。完了正好去坐19:45的小火车，转完一圈下来差不多20:30左右，又看了看爬行动物那一小圈，没大有意思，然后在大门口看了21:00的喷火表演。完事以后回日间动物园去看幻光雨林。然后21:50包车回酒店。时间都刚好，该看的都看了，就是幻光雨林走得很累很着急，没想到要走老大一圈。夜间动物园可以拍照，就是不能用闪光灯，有微弱的灯光可以看到动物。动物晚上比白天活跃，就是我们坐着小火车，拍照手机晃动厉害，拍也拍不清楚，很可惜，没有一张能看的。配货表演录了全程视频，可惜不能上传啊。,08/11/2018,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157174570?locale=en-SG,Safari
M23***67,5.0,夜间看动物蛮有趣的。。。携程中文小火车有种贵宾的感觉。提前入园，优先上车。选的19.15的，刚刚好，天黑，还能看清楚一点，后面的时间估计很难看清楚。转了40分钟吧。就开启徒步模式，走了4条小径。没有去看表演，排队人太多，带着小朋友不方便，建议想看的，早点去排。看图吧，晚上不好拍，将就看吧。,23/09/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-156717192?locale=en-SG,Safari
208***99,5.0,提前预定7：15分的中文小火车，原因看其他攻略，因为很值得。之后步行阶段联系顺时针绕，感觉大部队都是逆时针。火车下来天已经暗了，步行道逆时针人很少，体验还是不错的，蝙蝠馆近距离看蝙蝠有点瘆人，之前我家宝贝是不敢进去的。,08/09/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-156591582?locale=en-SG,Safari
妮妮吖头,5.0,三个动物园的一天，虽然稍稍有点紧，但都非常值得，介于Masai Mara National Reserve和国内动物园之间，体验感非常棒，夜间动物园有种走进神秘森林的感觉，个人认为是必须来体验的，晚上10点出园外面仍然有很多大巴车和人流，所以绝对不要担心交通不便。,07/09/2018,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-156582517?locale=en-SG,Safari
203***91,5.0,感受一下国内没有的夜间动物园，坐小火车游览一圈可能需要1个小时左右，并且不用排队，直接进去找到5号站台就上火车，换票也挺方便，直接在日间动物园买票口右边机器上换票，非常快捷，火车上有中文介绍，动物和火车隔了一段距离，小朋友在火车上兴致很高，坐完火车又下来排队看了一场动物表演，主持人挺能调动大家兴趣，最后出门的时候看了大门口的火焰表演，非常精釆，动物园外都有餐厅，很方便，出来跟着人流走就能到公交或的士站。,17/08/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-156183997?locale=en-SG,Safari
Cinderella Princess,4.0,新加坡夜间动物园距离新加坡市区略有距离，地铁转公交坐了好久，到了排队等入园小火车又是半小时，甚是累人，小火车还是开放式的，现在想想有点后怕呢，万一老虎冲出来。。。说实话，夜间是一种体验，但真的没有白天看的清楚，因为闪光灯会影响动物休息所以拍照也不能用闪光。拍出来也是黑乎乎的一片。,01/01/2018,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-152394176?locale=en-SG,Safari
Tiffanygong,4.0,到新加坡的必游景点之一，也是首家夜间动物园。提前在网上订好门票，会优惠一些，需要入园之前换好门票。进园可以选择缆车或是步行道两种游园方式，选择坐缆车的我，虽然沿途确实看到不少动物，不过可能夜间的关系，有些动物不是很清晰，推荐大家如果不是非常害怕的话，可以选择步行道。后面的动物表演尽管不是难度系数太高，但是在和观众互动时，还是挺配合的。园区门口的公仔娃娃真的逼真精致，T恤也设计感不错。,22/09/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-122237386?locale=en-SG,Safari
M23***82,5.0,夜间动物园是来坡的第一个出来玩的景点，看见了很多只有在电视上才看的到的动物，很值得一来。先去看了动物表演，水獭分类扔垃圾炒鸡可爱，然后我们走了四条小道，绕了一圈，然后坐小火车绕了一圈，总体下了来还是很满意。,06/09/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-121181439?locale=en-SG,Safari
Eaton2910,5.0,又一个孩子的乐园，除了坐游览车还可沿着小径漫步感受丛林探险，更近距离观看动物。地铁到Ang Mo Koi转138路公交车直达夜间动物园。138路公交车在公交换乘站里面的B1乘坐，换乘站在地铁站对面，有通道可直接进入换乘站。,27/07/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-115978246?locale=en-SG,Safari
M17***81,5.0,世界第一个夜间动物园，乘坐游览车在黑暗的丛林中寻找动物，独特的参观体验，为了保护动物不能开闪光灯照相，所以照片乌漆嘛黑的，还是要现场来看吧。每每在黑暗中发现一种动物时，兴奋的心情不可言喻。乘车游览后有四个小径可以步行更近距离参观，温顺动物都是触手可及的距离，没有铁笼隔离，走在黑黑的小路上，如果没有同伴真的是很恐怖，一次神秘刺激的发现之旅。,23/07/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116973941?locale=en-SG,Safari
大大大白熊,5.0,夜间动物园真是不一样的体验，提早看攻略选择7点15分进园，进园马上排队坐小火车，顺利坐上第二辆，小火车开的很慢，由于进去的早所以看的很清楚，因为下小雨所以没有走路继续观赏动物，夜间精灵表演也取消了，留下点遗憾下次再来吧！,14/07/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116905073?locale=en-SG,Safari

三三格_33,5.0,感受不一样的动物园，光听名字，夜间动物园，就已经够吸引我们，带着孩子一定要去感受下这份独特，过程很是辛苦，排队的艰辛和苦等唯有经历才会体会，但是还是值得一去。秀很好看，40分钟小火车，可以静静去观看夜间动物们的悠闲自在,01/07/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116838624?locale=en-SG,Safari
红发魔女,5.0,新加坡的夜间动物园比日间动物园更火爆，分时间场次入场，有一些动物散养在路旁，比如水鹿，马来貘等。可以坐小火车观光，车上有不同语言的解说，因为要保持夜间的安静，所以公园会发耳机给顾客。也有自己步行的区域，可以看到更多的夜间东西，也可以感受天黑与动物亲密接触的感觉，孩子们还是很喜欢这种体验的。动物园内还有各种美食，累了，饿了也可以解决。,14/06/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116762009?locale=en-SG,Safari
138***23,5.0,说实话，体验不如日间动物园。不知道为啥如此之火。7.15入内的门票没订到。订了8.15入园，含英文小火车的票。排队的时候，当地人说你们游客可以直接进入好像。我们去了，果然看了票就让进了，不非得按照门票时间。这样不用太晚出园了。我们看了9.30的表演，说实话一般。徒步了一个小径就出来了，实在没啥意思。从动物园出来，坐138路回到市区（开车约40分钟）。最后一班是00.10，但是最好11点之前就出园。,30/05/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116688292?locale=en-SG,Safari
克鲁杰,5.0,新加坡的夜间动物园，游客可以在热带丛林中观赏野生动物的夜间形态，还可以近距离无围栏的观赏一些温顺草食动物，乘坐上园区的小火车，一边感受着夜晚的静谧，穿梭在丛林中，寻找着野生动物们，别有一番趣味。   园区规划了两种游园方式，一种是乘坐小火车游览，一路上可以看到一些凶猛的大型动物，中途是不可以下车的，建议选择中文语音导览，可以听到动物简介。整条线路游览之后，可以选择另一种&mdash;&mdash;三条步道，可以近距离接触一些温和的食草动物。,11/05/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-106620560?locale=en-SG,Safari

小木**,5.0,夜间野生动物园，据称是世界上第一个夜间供游客游览的野生动物园，排队的游客就很多，都需要搭乘有限的游览车。白天睡觉的狮子豹子，半夜全起来活动，园子里最多的就是各种鹿，晚上一定要放亮眼睛看，很细微的观察到动物的真实生活，很激动和惊喜。,23/01/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-95840804?locale=en-SG,Safari
杨维康Alan,5.0,预约了8.45的中文小火车，一句话棒！虽说是夜晚丛林冒险，以为会看不清楚动物，不过大多数都还是看得清！我们的导游也很细心会提早告知我们动物的位置好让我们准备拍照，最重要的是学了好多有关动物的信息。小火车行程40分钟，结束之后，他还抽了点时间带我们到附近的小径逛一逛，非常棒的导游。幸亏没搭英语车不然就真的啥都听不明白！,16/01/2017,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-95141797?locale=en-SG,Safari
koki_,5.0,去的时候刚好7点左右第一波开园，游客并没有那么多，可以近距离的观察动物，配合导览车的讲解，对动物有了进一步的认识，保护动物以及它们赖以生存的环境与社会发展同样重要， 人类与动物和谐相处才是真正的发展之路。,31/10/2016,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-90960100?locale=en-SG,Safari
潼大爷他爹,4.0,特点就是夜间开放，但是缺点也是很显然，晚上里面虽然有路灯，但是很昏暗，怕吓着动物吧，带着孩子的话也没法走路参观，做园区的导缆车，20分钟一圈就转完了，从市区打车过去26块左右，来回50，加门票啥的，觉得不是很划算,03/03/2016,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-71372447?locale=en-SG,Safari
小呆兔,4.0,专门预定的中文游览车，加了10新币一个人，不用排队到点准时集合就可以，一天中文有两班，7：30和8：45，看着英文导缆车排队排到门口，觉得这10新币还是挺值得，不过这个夜间动物园眼神不好的，真觉得没看到啥，只有那些大型动物能很轻松的找到，另外不能打闪光灯，拍照基本不可能，就别浪费时间试了。除了游览车还有步道，不过黑漆漆的着实吓人，果断放弃！,23/11/2015,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-66729218?locale=en-SG,Safari
M36***02,5.0,夜间动物园有两条路线，第一条是游览车路线，坐着游览车听着耳机里的解说，带你绕着动物园一圈。解说会告诉你左边是什么动物，有趣的是你要在黑暗中找到它。奇特的感受。,05/03/2020,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-162952144?locale=en-SG,Safari

Fafa125,5.0,临时决定去的，在劳明达地铁站边上沟公交车站有班车经过，据说每天17:30和18:30有，很幸运的赶上了。主要冲着异域风情去的，动物基本看不清，可视度较低，不过动物园的教育意义还是很好，适合带小孩来。,15/05/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-107130645?locale=en-SG,Safari

M34***80,5.0,乘坐有轨电车很有趣，难以置信可以如此近距离看到大象和狮子，而不是在屏幕后面！袋鼠很有趣，他们在你身边跑来跑去！离开这个城市一段时间是很好的，而你在这里更能感觉到了。价格很合理，可在二级网站订票。,12/09/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-160890105?locale=en-SG,Safari
M30***69,5.0,令我们惊讶的是，晚上我们几乎看不到任何动物。 除了水牛，野猪和一只鬣狗。所以，我的建议是跳过电车选择步行，因为你至少可以等动物出现或看的尽兴，因为电车只停留一小会儿就走远了，因而你会错过很多乐趣。,11/09/2019,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-160875100?locale=en-SG,Safari
吃萝卜的鱼儿,5.0,注意：夜间动物园是不允许打开闪光灯拍照的！夜间去主要就是感觉黑不溜秋的，微风吹在身上加上树丛的沙沙声增加了些许紧张气氛，但也因为很黑，所以看动物都靠找。,05/03/2020,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-162952066?locale=en-SG,Safari

M22***85,4.0,新加坡夜间动物园是全亚洲唯一一个在夜间开放的动物园，我们去之前是在携程网定的门票，到了公园门口有自助取票机很方便，千万别忘了还有小火车票哟，在我们之前的一位游客就忘记取小火车票了，小火车上有中文、韩文、日文、英语等多种语言来介绍可爱的动物们，坐完小火车我们还观看了夜晚的精灵动物表演，还有4条小径可以游览，由于看完表演时间有点晚了，我们就没去了，总体来说还是不错的，值得一去。,15/09/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-122124404?locale=en-SG,Safari
189***65,5.0,作为唯一一个夜间动物园，又是野生环境的，来一趟新加坡一定会来一次的。总体来说不错，一定要定多语言车的票，才可以听到中文讲解。工作日19:30上车的票人超级多，但20:30上车人就不多了，可以很快上车。坐一圈大概40分钟，要瞪大眼睛跟着讲解语音去找动物。坐完车回来其实还可以走进去看看的，但小孩累了，一天玩三个园也是够累的，还要坐公交车回市区，所以就没再走小径进去看看，留下点遗憾以后再来吧,28/08/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-119913488?locale=en-SG,Safari

圣马丁赫莱斯谢道韫,5.0,跟着语音和地图导览游览新加坡夜间动物园不失为一种好的选择，动物园的导览一般都是英文。但需要提前熟悉地图的内容以及每种动物的位置，名称，以便很快找到并收听。否则在黑夜中可能会一团乱哦,14/03/2020,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-163006464?locale=en-SG,Safari

M22***11,5.0,很有特色的动物园，我们买了中文小火车，7点45上车，大部分动物看到了，只有几个没出来。整个过程半小时，看完天黑了，步行的人不太多，我们就不敢自己再逛了，觉得有点害怕。进门之前有个火把表演，进去之后看了夜间动物精灵秀，因为小火车时间快到了，所以没看完就走了，感觉也没什么意思，就是一个个动物走上台而已，没有什么表演。,15/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-160937868?locale=en-SG,Safari

狮子座的Pumpkin,5.0,新加坡有四大动物园，最有特色的我觉得当属夜间野生动物园，这个是国内比较少见的动物园。推荐搭乘中文小火车，不仅省时省力，还有讲解，适合小朋友们，省去了解答十万个为什么。我们搭乘5:30第一趟小火车，有人觉得那时候天不够黑，有的动物还没出来，其实行程中夜色已经降临，很黑了。,08/08/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-160174120?locale=en-SG,Safari

佛罗里达李清照,5.0,非常有趣又特别的经历。这个动物园恐怕是新加坡独有，可以看到很多不常见的动物。晚上7点开始，人不少。携程买的票秒到，正门口有自助打票机也很快。票里自带小火车但是英文路线，如果想选择中文小火车，需要加点钱，自己在柜台可以办理。步行在小路上，能寻找到很多小的有趣的动物。,12/02/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157866591?locale=en-SG,Safari

Sunning,5.0,新加坡夜间野生动物园(Night Safari)是世界首家于夜间供游客游览的野生动物园，它不同于其它夜间有照明的普通动物园，也不是那种可在世界上其它动物园见到的现代化夜间生物馆。游客可在夜间于热带丛林中观赏野生动物，从而获得独特的体验。可坐乘坐小火车游览，整个车程大约45分钟，有英语解说；也可以步行游览,31/12/2018,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-157543079?locale=en-SG,Safari

小病毒,4.0,其实是在携程上买的19:15 游览车票子（含大门票），也就是类似快速通道VIP的票子，非常方便准时看到了18:45的入场喷火show，然后一进门就直接坐上游览车的节奏。19:15开车的时候天空还是有点儿亮的，整个一圈下来45分钟天就暗了。游览车除了有几个地方 左右不分 有点儿小bug外，其他都介绍的挺到位。 当天长颈鹿没有出现，略有小遗憾，但在行车过程中，可爱的散养区动物朋友出来溜达，我们的车等它们走了之后才开的小插曲非常好玩。敞开式的游览车让人和动物距离更近了（安全距离）。非常佩服新加坡夜间动物园防昆虫的技术，在夜间的灯光下，很难看到飞蛾或者类似驱光类昆虫，我们连一个蚊子块都没被咬到。20:30的动物剧场也妥妥的赶上，坐在第二排非常开心。话说几个素质差马来人略煞风景。看完剧场演出，1个小时内把四条小径都探索完毕，小朋友非常有收获。园区内买吃的东西地方少，都在园区入门口。,07/08/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-156051132?locale=en-SG,Safari
小虫寵,5.0,在夜晚来看动物是一种很好的体验，当晚的生物表演很棒，挤满了各国的游客。 在下午六点的时候到达动物园，当我扫描我的入场券时，却显示九点才可以进入，夜间野生动物园的拍照是一个问题， 灯光太暗了，入口处的火表演也很好。,01/08/2018,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-155968773?locale=en-SG,Safari
LADYJJ,4.0,在售票处的自助打印机上扫一下拿票就可以了、7点15的票，7点左右就可以入园了、进去以后就排队做了车，然后就一边讲解一边看。比较暗、要用力看！前面的耳机在没开车之前能用、开车以后不知道为什么差了耳机也没反应、就只能听英语讲解了&hellip;车子下来也要9点了、没有在步行、因为晚上还是有点害怕的&hellip;,01/05/2018,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-154661049?locale=en-SG,Safari
游客冯睿祺,4.0,其实这个园子很一般，动物晚上7点15去比较好，再晚了就看不到了，有四条小路沿着整个园，是可以让人步行参观的，也有许多小生物，可以看看。不过实在是很小，和秦岭野生动物园相比就算是小巫见大巫了！但是许多夜间动物还是值得一看的，表演没什么意思。建议大家先坐车，然后直接去看表演，演出就在5号站台后面的圆顶广场。看完表演就可以自由决定是否继续逛了。,24/02/2018,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-153566596?locale=en-SG,Safari
M35***97,5.0,直接门口机器就可以取票，很方便。英文导览有口音，不容易听懂，而且很多动物名字不常见，有条件还是订中文的吧。要拍照建议带微单或者单反，园里基本没有光线，卡片机的噪点惨不忍睹。记得带驱蚊水。总体来说是很新奇的体验，值得尝试。,06/11/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-141603435?locale=en-SG,Safari
阿断断断,4.0,在迷你的新加坡，住在市区的话，来动物园这边还是挺遥远的。可以在史丹佛瑞士等几个酒店门口坐班车，往返11新元，就很方便啦。夜间动物园的乐趣主要在观察和体验吧，在黑漆漆的森林里穿行，闻一闻黑夜里森林原始的气息，都是难得的经历了，还有一点运气的成分，我们还看到了狮子的正脸。当然拍照就别想了，都是黑糊糊一坨。动物表演可以看一下，其实就是动物们轮流亮个相，不过主持人很会搞气氛，所以大家就算语言不通也看得很高兴（我们那场居然是日本人最多）。在网上订票，入园时间会根据现场的人数选场次，我们六点半左右去取票，还有第一场也就是7:45的可选，进去后先看表演，再排了40分钟左右去坐小火车，步行道就没有体验了，佩服那些一两个人还勇敢步行的勇士。,11/10/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-139000396?locale=en-SG,Safari
心跳100,5.0,真心不错！园内先进的照明技术，可让游客清楚地观赏动物，且不至于干扰它们的夜间活动。我们搭乘游园火车，安全舒适地观赏动物，建议英文不好的朋友买中文解说车票，有兴趣的朋友可以再走下步行道，这样可以接近一些电车上不易看到的动物。,06/10/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-138732212?locale=en-SG,Safari

M60***00,4.0,周六18.50的样子到的night Safari，那个时候19.15的票已经卖完了..幸好在携程上买的预定票。看到了许多在国内动物园看不到的动物，还是挺开心的。BTW，如果英语听力不好的朋友请选择中文小火车可能会比较好，但是英文小火车解说发音还是不错的，不是Singlish。,03/09/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-121106296?locale=en-SG,Safari

135***33,5.0,携程买价格便宜一点，一定要早点订啊，我订的时候已经没有七点多的门票，只有八点多，最后玩到12点，打的不好打，返回的人太多 ，要用优步等打车软件就很方便。取票有自助取票机，用手机上的取票码很方便 排队不多，进门排队超级多，大家都在等小火车，排队很久，其实走四条小径参观就不用排队，入口右转，因为没人指引，我们也跟着排了很久，后来才发现不坐小火车可以直接进去。夜晚的精灵表演是英文的，有人数限制，要早点去排队。,19/08/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-119688579?locale=en-SG,Safari
M22***41,4.0,夜间动物园名气很大，噱头也不小，超级火爆，人非常非常多，门票要提前预订，否则很容易售光，尤其是最早的7:15场。因为要赶地铁，基本上最晚十点之前，九点四十出来较好。45min的游览车排队人多且慢，我们算比较早进去靠前的，也排队等了四十多分钟，表演就没时间看了，小径走下来是一条路，一端进一端出，大概至少也要一个小时多。时间还是紧张的。其中最好看的就是蝙蝠了，马来大狐蝠体型比较大，夜间活动可看见其飞来飞去，到挂着吃水果。其他动物没太多心意，很多也不算典型的夜行动物，而且光线多较暗，眼睛也看不清楚，拍照就更难。,14/08/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-118416110?locale=en-SG,Safari

史胖子,5.0,上午飞禽公园，下午日间动物园，晚上夜间动物园，完美的动物园一日游！日间夜间动物园在一起，门对门，在新加坡的北面，算离市区最远的景点之一，市区打车过去20元新币左右，但绝对！值得去！动物园动线设计的很完美，真实的野外性，为每种动物量身定制生活环境，能近距离观赏各种动物。携程订票很方便，预订了中文小火车套餐，提前打印好预订单，在门口自助取票机上扫描条码就能取票。入口前右手边有一条长廊，各种美食与纪念品店，口头有一家冰淇淋店，黑巧克力冰淇淋超级超级浓郁！爱巧克力的朋友千万不能错过！可惜我爱的薄荷味一般。沿长廊一直走不拐弯就是中文小火车排队处，订了最早的19:15入园及20:00小火车，19:00就可以刷票进入了，可以先去看旁边的夜间精灵表演（天气原因会取消），到19:45左右去排小火车。有许多评论说夜间动物园没多少动物，没意思。我觉得很有意思啊，首先夜间观察动物习性就是前所未有的体验，热带雨林一样的环境也很舒适，乘坐小火车走在其间心情很愉悦，有开放区和非开放区，开放区的马来貘、小鹿、羊等温和动物就在身边，非开放区的老虎，狮子也在不远处活动，才知道它们都是夜行动物，难怪白天看到都懒洋洋的休息。运气很不错，所有动物都出来活动了，很满足。小火车一圈1个小时左右，下车可以自行入园观赏，有沙袋鼠小径等路线，不过夜间丛林让我们俩姑娘觉得害怕，就没进去走了，胆子大的朋友可以一探究竟！,26/02/2017,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-97963763?locale=en-SG,Safari

Michelle Regina,3.0,"The ticket states to reach 45 mins before the start time, strictly adhere to it if it&#39;s your first visit there. Not because there&#39;s a long queue or what but it&#39;s the buffer time in case you go to the wrong entrance. Zoo and Night Safari&#39;s entrances are just 5 mins apart. We reached early, thought it&#39;s at the Night Safari since zoo closes early, made a point to check with the visitor services if there&#39;s a need to exchange for physical tickets, the lady looked at the ticket with the barcode and said no need just queue at the entrance 15 mins before entrance time. We thought we were early and had some dessert at the food court when time drew closer went to queue up obediently as told, only at the night safari entrance that they found out our tickets were not for that entrance. Thankfully the zoo&#39;s entrance was only 5 mins walk away. Managed to get at the right entrance, wasn&#39;t any queue at all. Lights were okay, but of course cannot be compared to those overseas. Can be more creative and put in more effort to make the experience a memorable one. Import those candies with lumination lights in it.

Yang Alicia,5.0,总体来说还不错！动物秀的两个主持人还有饲养员都很可爱，很会调动气氛。小火车环节，由于现场人比较多，工作人员很机动的把游客分流开，引导游客去到不同的站点等待小火车。所以人虽然多但等待时间非常短。小动物们虽然要么没看到，要么在睡觉，也没有给我留下特别的印象，但总得感觉还是非常新颖的，我们一家都很喜欢！,21/09/2019,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-161095332?locale=en-SG,Safari

喵星人议事厅,5.0,不用排队！！！工作人员看了我们的票直接让上车了，看着一堆人比我们去的还早，还要在那里扇风排队的，我觉得这钱花的很值。前半程是亮天的，后面全黑了，拍不到啥照片，司机不错，到一个点都会停一下给大家看看。夜间动物园因为没看过，还是有点意思的，但是，其他动物园是真没劲，这动物也太少了，北京动物园10块的门票，看的动物比这多多了，更别说长隆。没意思啊。,23/07/2019,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-159880138?locale=en-SG,Safari
117***08,4.0,比较有特色的动物园，夜幕之下乘坐在小火车上听着英语解说穿梭在森林和动物之中。也有步行游览线路，可以近距离的接触到动物有些探险的兴奋，当然是都是些没有攻击力的小动物了。游客还是蛮多的，入园前排队很长。缺点就是动物种类略少，整个动物园范围也不大。夜晚对视力不好的人来说，可能较难看清动物。,15/07/2019,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-159760365?locale=en-SG,Safari

小鱼盆儿,4.0,晚上19:30转战night safari，夜间动物园。买的票可以选择场次，如果含中文导览车，可以直接走5号通道，无需在大门外排队，直接排队坐导览车即可。导览车最早的一场是19:15，之后是19:45。缺点是直接去导览车排队有可能会错过演出。沿途介绍很多动物，得拼命瞪大眼睛看，才能看见个模糊的身影，就是听见附近有豺狼虎豹这些大型野兽时，心里稍有紧张。,02/08/2018,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-155978523?locale=en-SG,Safari

_WB***81,5.0,小火车中文讲解的票需要在日间动物园的售票处兑换，而门票在夜间动物园的自动售票机兑换 两个距离走路大概5分钟，这个确实有点儿绕中文的解说其实是录音，到5号站台的时候会发给你一副耳机 到时插在小火车座位的前的耳机插口上。大概40分钟的样子夜间动物园的所有商铺都可以用支付宝,02/05/2018,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-154680887?locale=en-SG,Safari

做一只自由自在的飞鸟,5.0,新加坡夜间野生动物园于1994年开放，是世界上第一个专为夜间动物而设立的野生动物园。园区内居住着超过2500只动物，游人在宽阔的自然栖息地中观察夜行动物的行踪。,30/10/2017,1,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-141488846?locale=en-SG,Safari
_We***51,5.0,门票很好用，当天订票，一会就收到链接了。但是稍微去晚了点，快8:00的时候只能换到9:15入场的票了，7:15和8:15卖完了。表演很棒，小火车游览比较省力气，因为太晚没法再走那些小径了，有点遗憾，一定要早点去换票。,01/10/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-138578820?locale=en-SG,Safari
189***65,5.0,夜间动物园是新加坡的特色了，是一定要来的，买的是多语言导览车的票，7:45排队人很多，8:30的人就不多了，我们排前面的还被塞进了前面的车里，提前出发了。我们还是要依靠灯光才能看到动物，听着解说也学到不少知识。很不错。就是携程的票，买的3个人3个园的票和导览车或船，结果一共出来14张票。背面都是景点名称的缩写，自己很难区分出来进哪个园要哪几张票，索性就给门口的工作人员来看吧。可能新加坡特色就是这样吧，发个照片感受一下,29/08/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-119919173?locale=en-SG,Safari
M73***38,5.0,玩好日间直接去了旁边的夜间，可以在自助机上取票，还挺方便，七点十五的小火车其实七点就坐上去了，下了车去圆顶剧场看了动物表演，主持人很会活跃气氛，由于一天下来太累四条小径没有逛直接出去赶了市区巴士，据说跟着饲养员会看到很活跃的动物,29/08/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-119917774?locale=en-SG,Safari
HALO-X,5.0,门口好吃的不错。怎么说呢，动物园没有国内长隆好，晚上去有点怕，而且很多动物看不清楚，就是坐着观光车游览一圈，也没有什么稀奇的动物，约的时间太晚，加上小朋友赶飞机旅途劳累差点睡着，应该理解为不够吸引他们吧，毕竟小朋友只要有感兴趣的东西不会觉得困。再要强调下，携程订票真的很方便，输入码直接取票，不用排队。中途出现小问题，存码的手机没带，用朋友手机上携程账号，打电话重新发给我短信，很快解决，才可以让行程圆满没有浪费钱。携程票务棒棒哒,03/08/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-118035487?locale=en-SG,Safari
_hn***89,3.0,路途比较远，晚上太黑，光线的因素，没有看清楚几个动物。园区也不大，感觉一个小时足够坐车结束，然后大家就出门了，不过我推迟了一个小时出门，观看了夜行动物表演，虽然一般，总比进来再出去强吧。反正比起国内长隆我认为一般。,02/08/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-117109823?locale=en-SG,Safari
Summer_Wang,4.0,说实话夜间动物园没有期待的来得好，但还是值得尝试一下的，原先在携程上购买的20:15入场的票（想着便宜也就英文小火车），但是到了现在才知道，暑假的关系太热门，光是排队就有好几十米的队伍，特别这个点，询问了华人工作人员，后来在现场多➕了10新币的中文火车票类似于优先票有专属通道直接到小火车，还是值得的，有多种语言选择；再者动物园的种类不多，因为定义夜间动物园也就只有那么几种夜行动物，鹿丫马丫比较多，比起日间动物园种类少很多，动物园环境还是很幽美的，毕竟新加坡本来就是花园城市，有种原始生态的感觉，还好有一火车的人，不然夜里还是有点吓人的，有点好处就是设置了四条步行的参观路径，大可以放心园区安排得妥妥的，不会让你误入险镜的；还有一点比较吸引人就是许多动物真的是散养的，小火车就在旁边经过，它们也处变不惊，感觉我们才是被参观的，可以拍照但是不能用散光等，夜间光线的关系不够清晰,30/07/2017,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-117041240?locale=en-SG,Safari
M54***40,5.0,打车到动物园后在自助取票机那里输入密码就能取到票，我们排了5分钟的队就取到票了，还能接受。拿票之后旁边就是入口，提早很多已经在排队了。订了19:15场的建议18:30准时取票然后取入口排队。这样的好处是能够看上第一场&ldquo;夜晚的精灵&rdquo;演出，看完演出后就去坐了游园小火车，大概排了20分钟队，小火车全程大概30分钟吧（凭感觉，没有严格计时）。总体感觉就是新加坡动物园真的非常棒，对动物的圈养非常人性化，坐火车的过程中看到除了老虎，其他动物都是不用笼子养的，我们还看到一只鹿从路上走过，小火车停下来让它。非常不错的体验，和国内动物园是完全不一样的。小火车下来之后大概是21:15，有时间的话非常希望能够步行走几个展区，可惜我们急着离开。非常推荐的一趟夜间之旅！,09/07/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116876128?locale=en-SG,Safari
137***43,5.0,电子取票比现场购票要少排许多队，所以提前购票很有必要。夜间购买了中文小火车，觉得很值，因为动物这些专有名词，如果听英语的话理解上面就会差很多，而且中文小火车可以快速上车，不用排很久的队伍等火车。夜间动物园里吃饭很贵啊！建议提前吃点，或者稍微带点食物和水。,08/07/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116859566?locale=en-SG,Safari
Chris_LYH,4.0,订到7：15那场，从市区打车过去大概28新币左右。到的有点晚直接换票进场，没看到喷火秀，直接逛四个小径。8：50左右直接去圆顶表演场，大概半小时表演然后坐小火车逛一圈。大体算下来这个行程人比较少。整个动物园感觉一般般，比较适合小朋友，我们这些大朋友感觉不到太大的兴趣。不过整个购票过程倒是非常的方便。,21/06/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116788503?locale=en-SG,Safari
孙可佳,5.0,除了排队之外，其他还可以，因为晚上动物傻兮兮的看到你的样子还是蛮好看的，散养区有些动物是要看他心情才能看到的，有点意思。看了满满的点评，我5:30分就到景区了，果然亚洲人都开始排队，我很幸运的排在了第一批，结果售票机取票，我的智商啊，但是还是建议早到，入园是7:15，满满哒都是印度人全在排队我也是服了，然后7:30分show，也是一进去先排队，看到20分钟要出来排导览车的队，还好我妈咪真的排队能手，行程很顺利，感觉很夸张，但是真的好多人，我9点半出来还有人往里面进，但是9:30进就没什么表演了；然后普遍地铁换公交到，时间都是在1小时左右，加上排队，我当天就没怎么安排行程，不然怎么赶得上全是第一波；有机会我还会再去，因为考虑到妈咪年级大，她会累啊，怕黑夜，其实我还是想自己只走走的，走的路线和车子不一样，车子环形一周，走的话就是真的像晚上在森林里走，有意思的,20/06/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116787713?locale=en-SG,Safari
shuijing0201,5.0,孩子非常喜欢。很特别。虽然动物并不能看的很清楚，但我们不就是向看一下概况，找个感觉的嘛。又不是要当动物学家。门口的戏火表演很彪悍！夜晚的游览车演说很到位。个人还是最喜欢看马来西亚貘啊。好特别啊但是所有美妙我这非专业相机是无法记录呀,22/04/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116494006?locale=en-SG,Safari
M33***38,5.0,真的好好玩，比一般动物园那种要么把人关在笼子里要么把小动物关在笼子里的感觉要好很多。没有危险性的动物都是可以自由活动的，有危险性的在夜间观赏时也感觉不到周围的电网，沟壑之类的阻隔措施。还可以走进铁门铁帘和吃水果的蝙蝠亲密接触。夜游热带雨林的感觉实在不能更好。,18/04/2017,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-116478791?locale=en-SG,Safari

稻草人cyq,4.0,据说是第一家夜间动物园，能够满足都市人对野外丛林的好奇心，所以也是很火。夜间动物园人满为患可以说堪比环球影城，经过实践，认为最好的游览顺序是进去以后先步行参观四条小径，和各种夜行动物近距离接触一下，然后看准时间去看SHOW（入口右边），再接下来人会稍微少一点，去做观光车。SHOW总体来讲很有意思，网上盛传会在观众座位下发现蟒蛇，这是既定好的情节，就是用来吓人的&hellip;&hellip;有会叼垃圾瓶子灌篮的河狸,26/10/2016,1,https://sg.trip.com/review/night-safari-10758318-90092094?locale=en-SG,Safari

_CF***24,3.0,美好的新加坡之旅就被携程给搞的不愉快。1.25当天下午孩子说要去海洋馆，在海洋馆门口想着看看能不能携程订票就不去排队了。搜了票发现跟现场价格差不多，就想着直接买吧。有大人票，儿童票，家庭套票（两大一小），正好我们是两大一小就直接套票吧，页面也显示可以定当日票，马上就点着下一步买好票。到了门口工作人员说刷不进卡机，一看居然是2.1的票。工作人员问我们在哪买的票，回答刚刚携程买的，工作人员就说那你重新买一下，把那个套票退了。于是马上联系携程退票，客服说要6小时才能回复，我只好重新买票。套票居然没有当天，只好分开定，结果还比套票便宜（这是什么逻辑，不知道携程这么搞网络陷阱有意思吗）第二天客服告诉我不能退，还疯狂给我打电话，我说自己在新加坡，接电话很贵，让回国后联系，结果30号回国完全没人联系，还是我多次联系客服。携程又说要联系技术，联系海洋馆申请，这不是应该在接到我投诉后就该干的活了吗？拖到2.1也没给我个明确答复，票在退订过程中也不能转卖。买机票，订酒店都有提前几天可以退改规则，大不了收点手续费就行。网上购物也可以7天无理由退货，这个完全不能退我实在无法理解，非实名制，非特价票。,02/02/2024,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-180590949?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

蓓利,5.0,新加坡的S.E.A海洋馆是亚洲最大的海洋馆，在圣淘沙岛上，靠近环球影城。海洋馆设有49个生态区，适合全家带着孩子前来观赏领略海洋世界的缤纷多彩。一进门就是一艘大船的模型非常夺人眼球，这艘大船是按历史上郑和下西洋时所驾之船搭建的，新加坡人清楚的将郑和七下西洋的历程以及其深刻的意义告诉了来自世界各地的游客们，更表达了中华文明一定可以重塑往日的辉煌的信心！进去馆内参观，馆内的海洋生物是按地理位置来分布，逛完整个海洋馆等于完成了跨越全球的海洋旅程。海洋馆最大的看点是它拥有全球最大的海洋之窗，长36米、高8.3米的全球最大水族观景窗。站在巨大的玻璃窗前，看着各种各样的知名或不知名鱼类在你眼前飞舞，你会被奥妙神奇的海中奇境所震撼。海洋馆还有几大强力推荐，有看似植物，实为细胞动物的五彩珊瑚；有俗称魔鬼鱼但却性情温驯的巨大生物鬼蝠魟；有凶猛的海鳝、有摇曳犹如一幅水墨画的发光水母、有北太平洋巨型章鱼、有&ldquo;长鼻子&rdquo;的海龙等。交通：乘坐地铁东北线或环线在港湾站下车，然后进入怡丰城购物中心3楼，换乘圣淘沙捷运在滨海站下车。,27/07/2017,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-115360043?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

小野Planet,5.0,算是圣淘沙必去景点之一了。去过珠海长隆之后，并不觉得很惊艳，但是也绝对是全球顶尖海洋馆了吧。1.郑和下西洋算是非常有特色的陈列，历史重现的展品，巨型轮船的高度还原。可以看到轮船的侧切面，里面放了好多动物和粮食啊，家居啊，蛮惊人的。体现了人文历史，这是这座海洋馆的特别之处。2.巨型水墙这个没有看过的还是建议去看，非常的壮观。当然我觉得比珠海的还略小了，而且鱼没有那么多，鲸鱼那种大型的鱼，略少一些，感叹中国富强，地大物博啊！水墙前面二层楼还有给孩子画画涂鸦的桌椅，非常人性化。3.海洋生物中规中矩的海洋馆，适合带孩子去游玩，海洋生物品种也很齐全。不是节假日的话，人并不多。4.位置就在环球影城的大门正对着的方向，再走十分钟就到了，电子票直接刷条形码，不像国内一些团购还要还票神马的。提前买票比较优惠哦。,25/05/2017,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-108230229?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium
juki235,5.0,S.E.A海洋馆是亚洲最好的海洋馆，这里进门先是展示了郑和下西洋的用船，以及船载的货物模型。进去的水族馆真的是非常的精彩，各式各样的海洋生物种类繁多，目不暇接。里面还有餐厅，可以一边观看水族箱内的鱼类，一边吃着美味的菜肴，绝对非常的享受。,14/01/2017,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-95126058?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium
山水人生,5.0,海洋馆外的巨大玻璃窗让游客先睹为快的看到了海底世界的景致，除了游弋的各种鱼类和造型的各种珊瑚，这里还有巨大的沉船。如此的场景布置在曾经游览过的水族馆中还不曾见过，这时才体会到这里真正的是海洋馆，而不是水族馆。在门口的宣传影视片中，一句来自海洋的声音在告诫我们：&ldquo;大自然不需要人类，而人类离不开大自然。&rdquo;当我们在观赏来自海洋的动植物的时候，还真得认真思考这句震撼心灵的话语。走进熟悉造型的海底隧道，在观赏鲨鱼的过程中开始游览。整个海洋馆分区域介绍世界各地著名的海洋流域和鱼类生物，通道两侧的设计和布置都非常新颖，整个海洋馆显得非常大气。来这里参观的游客很多，其中很多人都是带着孩子，天真活泼的孩子在大自然氛围中开始认识各种海洋动物。因为有中文介绍，因此这是我们在国外类似的水族馆所看的最开心的一次游览，可以通过图文并茂的介绍认识各种新颖的海洋动物。与那些孩子们相比，我们对海洋动物的了解也不比他们知道更多。作为亚洲最大的海洋馆，这个馆内的海洋生物是按地理位置来分布的，从卡里马塔海峡和爪哇海、马六甲海峡和安达曼海、孟加拉湾和拉克代夫海、波斯湾和阿拉伯海、红海、东非，到南中国海，这些熟悉或不熟悉的地名带给我们的是不同的海洋生物展示区。海洋馆内的通道和水箱布置的都是非常有特色，通道上的画面，水箱的各种形状，配合上灯光的照射，在昏暗和明亮的交替中给游人身临其境的感觉。而可以触摸海洋生物的地方，工作人员的热情介绍和海洋生物的神奇，也引起游客跃跃欲试的冲动。在这座海洋馆内最令人难忘的除了千姿百态的鱼类，还有漂浮游动的彩色水母，更有号称全球最大的海洋之窗。当我们和游客一起坐在巨大的玻璃窗前，看着游弋的各种鱼类，情不自禁为奥妙多姿的水中奇境所震撼。从鲨鱼到珊瑚，从巨鳗到小丑鱼，从章鱼到海豚，从蜘蛛蟹到狮子鱼，从海马到长牙锯鳐，各种海洋动植物让我们流连忘返，时间在不知不觉中很快流逝。这里的水族箱内都有沉船的设置，有的甚至还摆上了带有珠宝箱和瓷器餐具的沉没痕迹，如此一来观赏起来还真有些亲临海底的意味。海洋馆的中文导览图上介绍说，这个海洋馆拥有超过800个物种的10万多只海洋生物。正如文字所描述的那样：&ldquo;在这里，发掘蓝色王国的无限奇观，为奥妙多姿的海中奇景所震撼着迷。&rdquo;,15/12/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-93198404?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium
浅颜墨,5.0,进门之后非常震撼的是新加坡人将郑和下西洋的历程描绘的很深刻。郑和七下西洋，将中华文明威布四方，我记得至今东非有一民族与中国传统一样用扁担挑水和搬运物品。台风剧场很震撼，虽然明朝没有在为的&ldquo;兴宗&rdquo;皇帝，但是故事表现了中华名族沿海居民与海与天休戚与共的关系。我们曾经有骄傲的航海历史，我们也一定可以重塑辉煌开拓万里波涛！海洋馆内的水族馆很大，人很少，比陆家嘴的欣赏角度好很多。,30/10/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-90944067?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

李圣楠Rainbow,4.0,世界最大的海洋馆，汇集了世界各地超过万种的海洋生物，海洋馆里的每一种小细节都能让你惊喜。Tip：进岛之后去海洋馆路线：乘坐圣淘沙捷运，经过一站到&ldquo;滨海站&rdquo;下车。朝小型鱼尾狮雕像前进，这个时候直走就会看到左侧的Candylicious糖果店，这家店我和叔儿是游完海洋馆出来之后逛得，下面详解。看到了糖果屋就能看到环球影城和海洋馆了，两个景点挨得很近。所以第二天我和叔儿轻车熟路的直接到环球影城，一分钟没耽搁！ 海洋馆内的冷气十足，怕冷的朋友可以选择带一件薄外套，毕竟要在里面待上两三个小时，加之屋内屋外温差较大，尤其是小朋友们着凉就不好了海洋馆内分了不同的展区，例如刚进馆的&ldquo;沉船&rdquo;区，有一艘破旧的沉船，鱼儿在船周围游来游去，丝毫不知道这艘陈旧的船曾经发生过什么故事。那种情景好似电影情节般，把人带入进去进入海洋馆之前，会先看一个海事博物馆，在下一层才是海洋馆。在这个海事博物馆里面有个投影屏幕，上面播放郑和下西洋的历史故事。另外馆内还陈列着当年海上贸易的货物，以及航海路线的介绍与普及其中还有各民族展品，非常有特色。在观看小鱼之前学习学习航海知识，增加见闻,19/05/2016,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-84406708?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

顺时针1986,5.0,去新加坡圣淘沙游玩，看到环球影城排起好长的队伍进入，对于不爱凑热闹的我果断转到旁边的S.E.A海洋馆。这个海洋馆属于圣淘沙名胜世界一部分，堪称亚洲最大的海洋馆，S.E.A.不只是占地面积大，其种类繁多的海洋生物、各色主题区域更吸引眼球。海洋馆有49个生态区，馆内的海洋生物是按地理位置来分布，从卡里马塔海峡、爪哇海、马六甲海峡、安达曼海、孟加拉湾、拉克代夫海、红海、东非再到南中国海，在感慨海洋世界的缤纷多彩的能完成跨越全球的海洋旅程。这个海洋馆最大特色是拥有全球最大的海洋之窗，长36米、高8.3米的全球最大水族观景窗，让你静静的在那看着就能看到四处游弋的各种鱼类。我觉得最漂亮的是水母，它们停顿在那身姿婀娜，配合上不同颜色的灯光，半透明的身体呈现出五彩的效果，拍照超级漂亮。S.E.A.海洋馆还拥有伊氏石斑鱼、苏眉及其他温性的巨型海洋生物，200 多条鲨鱼，穿梭其中真的让人觉得刺激又惊喜，超级合适亲子游，能给小朋友增加很多海洋和生物知识。海洋馆营业时间是上午10时&ndash;傍晚6时，单日票成人29新元，差不多150元人民币，我在网上预定的门票101元人民币，而且是及时出票，不用提前预定，也不用取票，直接凭手机上的二维码扫码进园。推荐地铁前往，搭乘地铁东北线或环线至港湾站下车后出来到圣淘沙环球影城，海洋馆就在环球影城旁边，新加坡打车不是一般的贵，如果在新加坡逗留3日以上的，强烈推荐购买一张3日游的地铁通票，20新元，相当于100元人民币，乘坐地铁都是无限次的，可以省下不少的交通费。,01/11/2019,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-161797363?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

三十奶爸,5.0,带着娃去过三个海洋馆，大连圣亚、珠海长隆、名古屋水族馆，新加坡的SEA海洋馆算是第四个。这个海洋馆鱼类展览的方式是最多样，鱼的种类应该是最多的，且更多的鱼缸都是混养的。最特别的纪念品就是孩子可以手绘压膜的胸针。因为与海事博物馆是连着的，买了联票的话建议是先游览海事博物馆，看完台风剧场（3新币一张票），剧场出口右转可以进海洋馆，海洋馆第一个鱼缸与台风剧场的故事是有剧情连贯的。我觉得海事博物馆唯一的亮点就是台风剧场，其他的看个人兴趣了。不爽之处是压制纪念币的机器，有的只收纸币，有的只收硬币，头疼。。。,26/06/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-159460543?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

阿悠麻麻,5.0,据说新加坡的SEA海洋馆，是世界上最大的海洋馆，带着小朋友来新加坡旅行，一定得来看看啦。海洋馆在圣淘沙岛上，就在环球影城的斜对面。一走进海洋馆，我们先看到了一艘大船，上面正放着郑和下西洋的动画故事。往里面走，看到很多过去新加坡作为一个港口时期的历史，大小船只，各种手工艺品、动物等等。参观完这些后，然后才是海洋馆的入口。海洋馆确实很漂亮，小朋友看到各种各种的海洋生物在游来游去。这里有一块巨大的观景窗，超级漂亮，小朋友站在这里看了很久很久都不愿意离开。看着那些鱼儿游来游去，感觉自己也身在其中了。第一次看到那么多水母，晶莹剔透的样子。还有很长一条玻璃海底隧道，鲨鱼就在你的头顶游过。如果说环球影城是新加坡不可错过的亲子乐园的话，那么SEA海洋馆也是亲子游的另一个好去处。,16/10/2018,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/sea-aquarium-101913-156987127?locale=en-SG,SEA Aquarium

QQ.Zhang,5.0,新加坡🇸🇬圣淘沙岛🏝🏕🏖 圣淘沙（马来语：Sentosa），在马来语中意为&ldquo;宁静&rdquo;，是很受欢迎的新加坡岛屿和旅游胜地，每年约有2千万游客到访。岛的南岸有长度超过2千米的海滩，二战留下的西罗索炮台（Fort Siloso）、两个高尔夫球场及7间酒店。当中还包括圣淘沙名胜世界及其运营的新加坡环球影城主题公园🎡🎢🎠🏰⛵️,29/03/2023,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-175334229?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
事事随缘,5.0,如果有机会，能够在一个城市，慢悠悠的多呆几天，如同当地人一样的生活，而不是打卡式的景点游玩，我想这是了解一座城市的最佳方法。新加坡来的游客非常多，每个旅游团必来的景点之一，无非就是鱼尾狮啊等等这些地方，人山人海，要想完美的拍摄一张照片，而且旁边不要有其他人，难度系数比较高，其实，城市化的东西，无论走到哪里都是差不多的，倒不如多去探访一些自然，至少也是与自然结合得比较好的地方，到是可以真正的放松一下平时忙碌的神经，我认为新加坡虽然也都是高度发达的现代化城市，但在水泥丛林中他的自然环境却也鼓捣得很好，素有&ldquo;花园城市&rdquo;的美称，干净整洁，舒适宜人，国土面积不大，但是绿化率很高，动植物充分体现了热带岛屿的特征，这里并没有名胜山水，但精心的把城市建设成为了一个大花园，自然环境好了，各种鸟类自然而然的在此栖栖繁衍，绿树成荫，椰风海韵，鸟语花香，把这里打造成了飞禽王国，新加坡的确有很多地方值得我们学习,09/05/2019,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-158752522?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
远行-遇见你,5.0,黄金的沙滩，世界闻名的锦标赛高尔夫球场，升涛湾的深水游艇码头与豪华私人住宅区 &minus; 这些都是圣淘沙每年吸引上千万名游客的主要原因。岛上万众瞩目的旅游景点 &minus;圣淘沙名胜世界－不仅享有新加坡史上第一座综合娱乐城的头衔，其中开设的娱乐景点还包括了东南亚地区首创的环球影城。圣淘沙离商业市区不远，访客能选择乘坐圣淘沙捷运，风景宜人的缆车或通过圣淘沙跨海步行道抵达圣淘沙，路程只需几分钟。圣淘沙岛还要一个必刷景点，就是亚洲大陆最南端了，其实是一座吊桥将Palawan与另一座小岛相连。圣淘沙岛上的捷运都是免费的，只有上岛时要收费，离开和其余来往的捷运都免费直接乘坐就可以啦。日落，就静静的坐在这个沙滩上，牵着对方的手，看着夕阳缓缓而落，嗯，不错。,18/08/2017,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-119674997?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
无非子,5.0,圣淘沙太好玩了，三天绝对不够。走到哪都有好玩的，唯一的缺点是，岛上物价贵。        岛上除了Taxi，其他交通工具都是免费的，有接驳小火车，还有环岛Bus。Bus每一站都有不同的景点，班次非常密集，这点很人性化，但末班车时间周末和工作日不一样，需看清楚。入住香格里拉还有从怡丰城来往酒店的免费bus，为我们省去了不少时间和精力。        圣淘沙水上探险乐园在诸多游玩项目中不算热门，但事实证明，这个乐园玩一天也不会腻。除了常规款惊险滑道、休闲漂流、冲浪戏水外，还有好几项特殊活动，比如海豚探索、珊瑚礁浮潜、海底漫步、与鳐鱼互动等收费项目。我们提前预约了海豚探索，真的是不虚此行，除了照片价格贵之外，无其他毛病。海豚互动约1个小时，加上等候和讲解，前后一共1个半小时。      圣淘沙之所以吸引人，除去那些好玩的游乐项目外，走到哪都有可能会有不经意的节目呈现在你眼前。当我们饱餐一顿沿着河边散步时，忽然眼前出现了两只翩飞起舞的仙鹤。虽然之前有看到&ldquo;仙鹤芭蕾&rdquo;的指示牌，但决没有想到是如此精彩的仙鹤。        新加坡一共有三座有名的鱼尾狮，最让人知晓的一座在滨海湾，但最大的一座是在圣淘沙岛上。恰逢新加坡国庆期间，7月-8月期间，这头坐落在岛上的鱼尾狮大放异彩，每晚的20:40和21:40有两场投影灯光秀，最近计划去圣淘沙的朋友别错过咯！    入住圣淘沙香格里拉，会有猴子出没。本以为我们住在高楼层，看到猴子几率会很小，没想到，早上睁开眼，就看到一猴儿正趴在阳台的栏杆上，用期盼的眼神看着我们。同为吃货一枚，怎能不晓得这眼神的含义，赶忙找出一包坚果来，这下子又跑来两只，逗趣取乐了一番。        早餐时，还有孔雀在旁散步。岛上沿海沙滩边也会偶遇到孔雀。        环球影城两次变形金刚+侏罗纪河流探险、未来水世界特效演出，史瑞克4D电影、鞋猫剑客历险记、马达加斯加木箱漂流记、芝麻街意大利面太空站、小黄人越狱秀、魔法转轮，除了不敢玩的和不好玩的，其余的基本都刷到了[耶]，爽歪歪的一天。        西乐索炮台天空步道（就在香格里拉度假村旁边）以及亚洲大陆最南端必须要去打个卡。        时光之翼提早20分钟检票进去，虽然有分检票口，但进去后座位不固定，我们挑选了中间第一排。很精彩的一出水幕灯光、烟花秀，值得一看。,02/08/2017,12,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-117096925?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
endlesssummer,5.0,圣淘沙岛据说是新加坡花了不少钱打造的度假胜地，不过真心觉得岛上东西都好贵啊。吃的一份泰式面辣的出奇但价格更辣吃饭的话建议岛外的怡丰城里解决价格更亲民。上岛可以坐缆车，捷运，当然有个徒步传送带有顶棚的，还可以看风景是免费的，很推荐。缆车，捷运都是要票的。。。但是出岛捷运可以免费搭直通怡丰城的，岛内交通捷运也是免费的。岛上商店很多，那家卖糖果的就很有意思不管买不买都值得参观一下，当然有孩子的买个做纪念品，送人都是很好的选择。岛内景点的门票都强烈建议网上订，到岛上换票这样比较合算,19/07/2017,11,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-112199750?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
小野Planet,5.0,圣淘沙岛，并不大的一个小岛，环线观光小火车，一分钟一站的节奏，感受一下，真的好小哦！推荐两个景点 1.环球影城必去的不用说了，非常多娱乐项目，但是太小的宝宝玩不了什么，完全是陪着大人玩，我们一家三口，分头行动，一个带娃，一个走单人通道，项目玩的特别快。估计孩子要到五六岁以后才可以坐那些机动游戏吧！不过随便看看恐龙那些也是不错的。2.SEA海洋馆如果你没有去过广州长隆，那么你会觉得很惊艳。那个海底隧道，很梦幻，还可以看到饲养员喂鱼。有一些潜水者和鲨鱼同池，看起来提心吊胆的。各种海洋生物齐备，很有趣。巨大的水墙，里面巨型的鲨鱼，鲸鱼都很壮观。当然最有特点的是门口的郑和下西洋，历史故事展，很有人文性。当然如果去过珠海长隆，那就不要有太多奢望，珠海更大更壮观，只是新加坡这里没有动物表演的，单这一点就很值得学习，保护动物！不看动物表演。3.鱼尾狮广场这个鱼尾狮，是一个大版的鱼尾狮，萌哒哒的挺可爱的，夜晚会照五彩灯很美，适合拍照。广场很欧美风，晚上还有歌唱表演，很嗨。周围有711，冰棒店，麦当劳，印度餐厅，饭店不是很多，但是吃住行蛮方便的，可以逛逛拍照。4.海滩不推荐，新加坡是货轮港口，很多货轮在近海，失去了海滩的那份休闲和风景线，海滩也比较小，沙石多，看一眼就走的节奏。总之，岛上惊艳的就是全新的公路设施绿化，人文比较友善，值得一去。住一天到两天都是可以的。,25/05/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-108290569?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
山水人生,5.0,早饭后离开宾馆后门，步行的附近的百胜地铁站搭乘地铁，经过换乘抵达圣淘沙岛对面的怡丰城。这几日在新加坡自由行，充分感觉到搭乘地铁的方便，也充分感觉到下榻这家宾馆从百胜地铁站搭乘地铁的方便。今天出行时间虽然是早高峰，地铁车站内人很多，但我们因为都是短途因此未感到不便。抵达怡丰城后后沿着通往圣淘沙岛的步行道，在观赏很漂亮的城市风景中，漫步前往圣淘沙岛。进岛可以搭乘高空缆车，这是最贵的方式。可以搭乘轨道列车，进岛收费每人4新币，出岛则不用。还可以步行，以前是收费每人1新币，目前是暂时不收费。我们决定步行进入，搭乘轨道列车出来，实践证明这是最经济的往来方式。进入圣淘沙步行道的长度只有不到600米，但廊桥下还设置了平行电梯，因此说是步行其实也是挺省力的。同时途中还有几个观景台，在上面不论看城区，看岛屿，还是看海港都是风光无限。蓝色的天空漂浮着白云，蓝色的海面游动着船只，天地之间是美丽的新加坡城市风光。虽然步行道上游人不断，但从进入圣淘沙岛游览的人数看，步行的人绝对是极少数。圣淘沙岛位于新加坡本岛以南500米处，东西长4千米，南北宽1.6千米，面积为3.47平方千米，是新加坡本岛以外的第三大岛。在殖民统治时期这里为英国海军基地，旧名绝后岛，1972年改名为圣淘沙岛。现已开发成设备齐全的海上乐园。作为一个很近的离岛，也作为新加坡的旅游圣地，圣淘沙绝对是游客吃喝玩乐的天堂。因此进入岛内来到入口广场前，就看到成群结队的游客，而且其中大多数都说得国语。,15/12/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-93198211?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
芝士妹,5.0,圣淘沙岛是新加坡一个必到的地点啦，这个岛上充满了新奇刺激好玩的玩意，如果能住上一晚是更好。岛上有环球影视城、海滩、博物馆和海洋馆等，光是玩这些就已经足够玩上两日了。到了晚上，灯光下的圣淘沙岛更添梦幻，既有免费的仙鹤芭蕾表演，还有要收费的海之颂，这些都是不容错失的。,27/11/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-92501661?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

_We***51,5.0,去新加坡旅游一定去的景点，园区里有好多游乐设施，风景也没得说。可以有多种方式进岛，我是坐缆车进的，价格100人民币，有些不值，只是在高处看了一下岛的全景。建议其他的方式进岛，然后去摩天塔看岛的全景，会节省一些。我12点左右进的岛，因为在环球影城游玩到了6点多，岛上的很多景点没看全，准备明天还去，这回有经验了，在岛上坐免费大巴穿梭各景点之间，会少走很多路。,26/05/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-74398293?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
E02***66,5.0,圣淘沙岛有几个可以玩耍的地方，一个是环球影城，这个必须安排一整天的时间玩耍，排队时间较长，一般都要40分钟到1个半小时～有优先票，但是很贵，相当于一张门票的价格，在影城商店都能买，但要记得货比三家，因为每家店可能当时也不同。还有sea海洋乐园，有海豚表演，可以安排半天。还有亚洲最南端的海滩和栈桥～还有一只新加坡标志性鱼尾狮，可以付门票进去他的嘴里和脑袋拍照，并看个新加坡的由来小视频～行程安排最好住在圣淘沙岛，一天环球影城，一天玩别的，有家最大的糖果店，可以买进口糖果～马来西亚美食城，吃的都是当地小吃，价格也便宜，比较推荐,23/03/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-71658142?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

fly_me_to_the_moon,5.0,✈️新加坡101种玩法之圣淘沙讲真，我觉得新加坡没啥好玩的，没有魔都繁华，也没有日本干净，食物没有马来西亚的好吃。可能我说话比较直白也比较极端，不喜勿喷。️新加坡市区感觉就是打个卡走人的节奏，完全不想再去第二次。新加坡也就圣淘沙岛比较好玩了。⚠️圣淘沙是人工岛，岛上就是个大乐园，有环球影城，天际线斜坡滑车，水上乐园等。还能看表演。住宿也不错，但价格相对来说比较贵。⚠️圣淘沙推荐玩三天，我都没有玩够哈！本来打算去水上乐园和海豚亲亲的，最后由于各种原因没去成，也算是小小的遗憾了。关于签证新加坡签证还是很方便的，据说签证时长是随机的，我和同事同时办理，我们都给了2年签哈！如何抵达圣淘沙我们下了飞机直接打车来的，新加坡打车不算贵，和上海差不多价格，在新加坡我用的最多的交通工具就是打车~圣淘沙交通捷运很方便，能去各个地方，入住圣淘沙酒店可以免费搭乘哦~⭐️圣淘沙酒店推荐名胜世界的酒店都不错，价格也都差不多。住在名胜世界的好处是去环球影城很方便~名胜世界迈克尔酒店Michael Hotel我们入住的是这家，旺季入住，两晚才2700+含双早。对比了其他名胜世界的酒店，这家价格最低。房间挺大的，视野不错，可以看到圣淘沙的merlion，但是真心不喜欢这个鱼尾狮，真的好可怕&hellip;&hellip;早餐很丰盛，导致我在圣淘沙一天就吃得下两顿&hellip;&hellip;泳池比较小，不过挺干净的，晚上泡泳池聊天很惬意~名胜世界硬石酒店Hardrock Hotel虽然没有住在硬石，但也连着来了两天。Michael早晨的早餐排队队伍很长，于是被带去Hardrock吃早餐，都是一个集团的酒店，所以早餐味道两家对比了下是一样的，口味和品种差不多，环境也差不多。Hardrock的泳池不错，还有人造沙滩，还是白沙滩嘻嘻~那天在这个小小的水上乐园玩了好久，最后圣淘沙上的水上乐园就不去了&hellip;&hellip;真是服了我们哈哈！圣淘沙玩乐✨1⃣️环球影城USS6年前去过大阪的USJ，感觉很不错！新加坡的比大阪的小，玩起来不来，一天可以刷园区两次，都用买fp。提前网上购票，300多，性价比很高！USS代入感没有USJ强，你们懂的，日本人比较high嘛~除了木乃伊和红蓝过山车没有玩，其他都玩了一遍。变形金刚刷了两遍！礼品店没有很强的购物欲&hellip;,27/10/2019,11,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-161735161?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
日夕回味,5.0,作为除新加坡本岛之外的第三大岛，是集主题乐园、热带度假村、自然公园和文化中心于一体的休闲好去处。可以在沙滩上赤足行走，沐浴海风；可以在37米的鱼尾狮塔上眺望，到看世界昆虫博物馆观赏；可以到高尔夫乐园里挥杆，到梦幻岛里体验。,28/08/2017,14,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-119901964?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
M32***33,5.0,订了节庆酒店，住了两晚，说实话，比较陈旧，完全不如国内的四星，价格还不便宜。不过岛上还是很好玩的，可以去亚洲最南端的沙滩，人很少，景色很美。环球影城可以玩一整天。酒店一般，不过几个酒店共用的泳池很好玩，刷房卡即可进入，类似一个小型水上乐园，够孩子玩半天了。免税店东西不算便宜，可以看看。岛上吃住玩都很方便，我们玩了两天有点没玩够，还有演出没看，如果时间允许可以玩3，4天。,30/01/2017,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-95941093?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

rai***nz,5.0,圣淘沙很棒，我们这次去一整天都泡在圣淘沙，4新币的轻轨一天内圣淘沙可以随便坐，早上开门先去环球影城，变形金刚需排比较久的队，别的项目都还好，半小时内都能玩上，我们1月底上午10点半进园下午4点半出园，想玩的项目都玩到了。海洋馆不推荐去，不如上海海洋馆内容丰富。亚洲大陆最南端这个地标还不错，我们去的时候正好夕阳西下，蛮美的，吊桥也很有感觉，晚上还有灯光秀。总的来说这次新加坡之行最推荐的就是圣淘沙这一天～,13/02/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-70821985?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

一抹秋日暖阳CC,5.0,圣淘沙四面环海，拥有新加坡三个最美丽且各具风格的海滩&mdash;西乐索海滩、巴拉湾海滩与丹戎海滩。高耸的椰树，随风婆娑；稀稀落落的茅亭，更增添沙滩的南洋风情。特别给力的是入岛后的交通工具如捷运、循环行驶的岛车都是免费的哦！,08/10/2017,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-138812058?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
plm0728,4.0,应该是新加坡必去景点吧，首先交通很方便，机场转个地铁到怡丰城，凭岛上预定的任何一家酒店的预定单就可以到三楼领取免费车票，坐小火车进岛。然后酒店会给免费三天的车票给你，可以在岛上任意坐车，这点是很方便的。吃的地方可以选怡丰城的大食代，东西很多也不贵。吃完还可以在里面逛，里面的东西很便宜，买够一百块还可以退税。岛里面玩的东西也很多，但是都是要收费的，可以选择性的玩，就算不玩，在酒店游游泳，晒晒太阳也是很好的。两天都没玩够。,05/02/2016,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-70657697?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
菩提彼岸,4.0,圣淘沙岛有多个部分，环球影城值得呆上半天，水上表演有剧情有激情，震撼；过山车的话，最推荐埃及法老王的那个，黑暗的过山车；4D体验值得一试再试，仿佛是擎天柱和大黄蜂带领着你一起战斗一样过瘾；带着幼儿的话，会惊喜芝麻街的表演；街舞表演也很赞。中餐不算贵，主食基本是10新币。或出园区后，岛上的&ldquo;马来西亚美食街&rdquo;也非常不错。另外，岛上海洋馆也值得参观，单独售票的。,07/01/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-69596132?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
happyhuihui1107,5.0,圣淘沙真的建设的太牛咯，两个大机器人伫立在岛上，让你以为进入到了科幻世界。新加坡的海底世界是我见过的最棒的海底世界，没有之一。一定会再去，环球影城觉得一般，因为宝宝才一岁，好多玩不了。岛上小火车很便利，景点与景点间小火车都停。海滩有点脏，估计是游客太多的缘故，整个岛设计的很美，会让人去了还想去！赞哦！,03/01/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-69094382?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

It is a free tourist site but if you want to enjoy some luxuries like the trick-eye museum, cable car, etc... you have to pay for those... but in general it is still an enjoyable place even without these luxuries.",24/07/2019,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-159900547?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
VV云云,5.0,圣淘沙是个很成熟的度假圣地，从酒店到餐饮，都有不同风格、不同价格的选择。第一天的晚餐，我们选择了走大众化路线的马来西亚美食街，这里以小吃、快餐为主，价格在圣淘沙里也算是最便宜的，其中炒果条值得推荐。仙鹤芭蕾是 Entertainment Design Corporation 公司特地为新加坡圣淘沙云顶世界创作的，由公司旗下荣获四届艾美奖的国际秀大师 Jeremy Railton 亲自操刀。他凭着担任第 57 届奥斯卡颁奖典礼的艺术指导和 2002 年盐湖城冬季奥运会的开幕式设计者而享誉全球。而他最具个人里程碑的设计就是北京故宫和拉斯维加斯弗里蒙特街上的两块世界上最大的电子显示屏。仙鹤芭蕾每晚免费上演于新加坡圣淘沙名胜世界的海滨坊。海滨坊可同时容纳800位观众。演出时间为每晚9点开始，演出时间约为10分钟。美食：不得不赞吐司工坊的早餐，6点半开始供应，无论是咖椰吐司、还是咖喱叻沙、公仔面，都是很地道的味道。至于价格，见仁见智吧，一家三口100元人民币管吃饱！福廊与美食街不同，每个店铺都是独门独户的，中西日东南亚菜都可选择，虽然比美食街的价格稍贵，但胜在环境好、味道好。在圣淘沙岛上闲逛，有两种特色的交通工具&mdash;&mdash;捷运和小火车。交通：捷运只有四个站，其实距离很短，最特别的地方算是各种颜色的车箱，你总会不自觉地期待下一辆会不同的颜色。景点：英比奥山上的蜡像馆，我们并没有进入，但看着这栋颇具东南亚风情的建筑物，特别有感觉。海岸线上有不同的海滩，最出名的是西乐索和亚洲最南端。当然，去惯海滩的人不会觉得西乐索有什么特别，人还挺多的。反而是亚洲最南端，有座小小的铁索桥，水清人少，还有个儿童水上乐园，更加吸引。,07/03/2018,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-153746534?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
语溪,5.0,圣淘沙是新加坡顶尖的度假胜地，娱乐休闲购物美食应有尽有。绿意盎然的热带雨林，黄金的沙滩，垂涎欲滴的美食，各种品牌的物品，还有最棒的环球影城。大人小孩都适合。而且环境相当干净整洁。尤其是孩子的天堂、乐园。,22/09/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-122229252?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
e83***80,5.0,新加坡的圣淘沙岛又是另外一个很值得推荐的景区。从地铁圣淘沙岛站下了以后，如果你要走路过去的话，就是不用额外费用。如果你想坐那个小火车进岛的话，就必须买票才可以要另外交钱，但是在岛上交通又是免费的。在圣淘沙岛，你可以用一天的时间估计就差不多了。里面有海洋馆，有环球影城，还有一些一家大小都适合的娱乐项目。在圣淘沙岛上面的游玩设施都能够在国内旅游网上面找到，买票也很方便。如果遇到天气好的话，圣淘沙岛上面有一个岛，是属于新加坡的最南端，在那里看日落估计会很漂亮，可惜我去的时候刚好遇上了阴天，所以没能够看到日落，有点可惜。,27/07/2017,11,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-114460651?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

AngelinWang,5.0,新加坡最热门观光胜地非圣淘沙岛（Sentosa Island）莫属了。&ldquo;圣淘沙&rdquo;在马来文里的意思是&ldquo;和平安宁&rdquo;，可能因为这个小岛曾经是英军的军事基地的缘故，新加坡政府才在收回它并决定将它建成一个完全度假地时，给予了这么一个美丽的名字。圣淘沙距离新加坡本岛仅半公里，由一座堤道跨海大桥与本岛连接起来。这里拥有不同系列主题的景点，可以迎合各种人群的需要。环球影城（Universal Studios）、海之颂（Songs of the Sea）和摩天塔（Tiger Sky Tower）都是世界闻名的景点。此外，别忘了去参观新加坡摩天观景轮，享受壮丽动人的新加坡全景（见XX页）。想要悠闲度假的游客可以在沙滩上沐浴海风，可以登山眺望，可以探索神秘的自然世界，也可以享受新奇的感官刺激。无论是白天还是黑夜，圣淘沙都会把自己所有的美丽与快乐时时刻刻传递出来。,02/03/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-98539425?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

蔡芷涵,5.0,圣淘沙距离新加坡本岛仅半公里，由一座堤道跨海大桥与本岛连接起来。小岛延续了新加坡&ldquo;花园城市&rdquo;的味道，放眼望去，一片郁郁葱葱。游客可以在沙滩上沐浴海风，可以登山眺望，可以探索神秘的自然世界，也可以享受奇妙的感官刺激。 &ldquo;圣淘沙&rdquo;在马来文里的意思是&ldquo;和平安宁&rdquo;，可能因为这个小岛曾经是英军的军事基地的缘故，新加坡政府才在收回它并决定将它建成一个完全度假地时，给予了这么一个美丽的名字。去圣淘沙游玩必看的节目之一就是观看《海之韵》表演，如果用新奇来形容可能过时了，不过还是可以看看的。 其中的水幕、焰火、喷泉表演非常好看，几个参加表演的演员也不错，还会唱&ldquo;凤阳花鼓&rdquo;，但主题歌好象不是太能打动人，不知是哪里的导演选择的，&ldquo;呵&rdquo;的好几次，没什么大反响新加坡南部岛屿。位于新加坡本岛以南500米处，东西长4千米，南北宽1.6千米，面积为3.47平方千米，是新加坡本岛以外的第三大岛。在圣淘沙岛殖民统治时期为英国海军基地，旧名绝后岛，1972年改名。现已开发成设备齐全的海上乐园。岛西端的英国碉堡西洛索炮台建于1880年。5世纪的古炮保存于此，内有复杂的地下建筑物城墙和炮座、大炮、臼炮。海洋博物馆陈列有新加坡港历史、航海术的发展过程等资料；新加坡居民早期使用过的独舟、原始的捕鱼方法、渔具等都用木板。,14/10/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-89912786?locale=en-SG,Sentosa
jimwy,5.0,圣淘沙棒棒的，由于带着4岁的孩子，选择在岛上住了2天，本来时间安排的不是很紧，孩子出之前的一天感冒，到了就开始发烧，第一、二天都是在酒店度过的。比较好的就是环球影城，所有的项目人非常邵，都不用怎么排队，第三天就把环球影城和海洋馆都去了，之后离开岛。,03/10/2016,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-89152293?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

李圣楠Rainbow,4.0,圣陶沙岛通过一条堤道跨海大桥与新加坡大陆连为一个整体，游客前往可以乘坐缆车、游船和汽车三种交通工具，十分方便。岛上遍布厅花异草，环境十分优美。同时，由于岛上拥有美丽的海滩、众多展览馆以及各式各样的娱乐设施，来观光游览者络绎不绝。Tip进岛路线：搭乘地铁紫色线（NE）至终点站&ldquo;港湾&rdquo;HarbourFrount下车或者搭乘地铁橙色环线至终点站&ldquo;港湾&rdquo;HarbourFrount 下车。下车之后从E出站口出，前往VivoCity怡丰城三楼，上楼就能看到SENTOSA圣淘沙售票处，电梯的另一侧便是大食代，从圣淘沙游完回来，可以选择在大食代吃饭，比较经济实惠。售票处立的牌子，上面写明了买票进岛，进岛费4新币/人，除了需要交4新币的进岛费之外，其余都是免费的啦，包括岛内来回做的缆车。但是岛内的部分景点也是需要买票进入的哟，大家只要记住这一点就好啦。另外买票时间会在上午9点半到十点有个排队小高峰。我们两个本来觉得第一天不是太赶没来多早，差不多快十点了来买票，已经是长长的队伍了，因为一些经典类似海洋馆和环球影城等都是十点开园，所以这一时间是进岛小高峰。如果不想错过景点不想排队的朋友可以提前来会儿。,19/05/2016,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-84406790?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

安迪去旅行,5.0,去新加坡没去过圣淘沙就等于白去了。SENTOSA很大，好看，好玩的东西非常多。从Vivo City商场的三层可以走路过去。指示牌写了Sentosa boardwalk，沿着走就看见长长的木板路，一路走过去就到圣淘沙岛了。当然也有往返的小火车，但是走过去完全免费，why not? 到了门口有套票卖。可以玩三个的，五个的都比你进去再一个一个项目买票便宜。但是套票不包含环球影城门票，需要进去单买。我买的是玩三种项目的套票45新加坡刀。当然你可以不买票进去光看看是可以不花钱的。两个必去的景点是环球影城和Sentosa merlion（圣淘沙鱼尾狮）。,20/10/2015,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-58904988?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

关裕年guanyunian,5.0,是用舌头添地没有土的国家吗？原来在什么地方有人这样描写新加坡的卫生状况，实在有些夸张。1988年带着这种意识来到新加坡，不免有些失望。但是，新加坡确实干净，由于面积小，所以便于管理，搞好卫生那还是容易的。绿化是第一流的，由于得天独厚的地理环境，雨水充沛，在加上本来就是&ldquo;巴掌&rdquo;块的地方，所以到处绿树成阴，鲜花盛开，整个城市是立体化的绿化，因此就成了花园城市。管理是第一流的，在街上，经常可以看到穿着黄马甲的扫地，这些人就是由于毁坏环境，而被罚打扫卫生的，如果有人随地吐痰，那就更加严重了，一般来说没有人敢。在一些饭馆周围，也不免看到地上有烟屁以及污垢，因此只要是社会化的管理，不可能没有死角。,13/07/2018,12,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-155681468?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

大熊猫猪,4.0,圣淘沙岛被誉为最迷人的度假小岛，占地390公顷，有着多姿多彩的娱乐设施和休闲。圣淘沙岛是新加坡新兴的景点，在我看来就是一个大型的游乐城堡，新加坡的游乐王国。游玩的项目很多，如果要细细玩，一天是绝对不够的。建议可以住在圣淘沙1晚，在沙滩散散步，或泡泡酒吧。用两天的时间玩的比较透。套票不是所有项目都包含在内的，一些热门的景点都没有。如环球影城、海之颂水上表演等。我个人不建议买套票。但如果想每个项目都玩的游客倒是可以考虑。每项都玩一天肯定不够，所以要问清楚这个套票的有效期是多长，如果是一天。那真没必要。,08/01/2016,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-69599571?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

bmi2004,5.0,由于没有做太多攻略，虽然知道去圣淘沙有船、缆车、公交、步行都可以到达，而且缆车是最推荐的，可是还是没来得及弄清楚到哪里坐缆车，坐乌节路跳上了一辆开往圣淘沙的公交就以为很快就到了，心想反正新加坡也就那么大，二十分钟总归能到吧，结果晚高峰有点堵车，而且是绕来绕去的，估计开了45分钟才到。已经是华灯初上，游客却是不减，非常有气氛，还可以在山顶看到山寨的mini鱼尾狮，整个小岛灯光效果非常好。中心舞台还有热烈的表演。,12/09/2016,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/sentosa-82520-87205431?locale=en-SG,Sentosa

Ryenicjen,5.0,"The Singapore Flyer is an iconic landmark that offers a unique perspective of the Lion City&rsquo;s breathtaking skyline. After a recent visit, I can confidently say that this attraction lives up to its reputation as one of Singapore&rsquo;s must-see destinations.	1.	Spectacular Views: The most obvious highlight of the Singapore Flyer is, of course, the panoramic views it provides. As the world&rsquo;s largest observation wheel, it offers a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the city that&rsquo;s simply awe-inspiring. From Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the Bay, and even glimpses of neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia on clear days, the vistas are nothing short of spectacular.	2.	Comfortable Capsules: The spacious and air-conditioned capsules are a comfortable way to take in the scenery. Each capsule has plenty of room to move around and offers both sitting and standing options, making it suitable for visitors of all ages.	3.	Informative Audio Guide: The audio guide provides fascinating insights into the city&rsquo;s history, landmarks, and architecture as you rotate above. It adds depth to the experience, turning a scenic ride into an educational one.	4.	Day and Night Experiences: Whether you visit during the day to see the city in all its vibrant glory or choose a night ride to witness the city&rsquo;s dazzling lights, the Singapore Flyer offers different experiences, each with its unique charm.	5.	Photography Opportunities: Photographers and Instagram enthusiasts will be in heaven. The Flyer provides ample opportunities to capture breathtaking shots, making it a must-visit for shutterbugs.In summary, the Singapore Flyer is a quintessential Singaporean experience that should not be missed. Whether you&rsquo;re a tourist exploring the city or a local looking to see your home in a new light, this giant observation wheel offers a memorable journey through the heart of Singapore&rsquo;s skyline. It&rsquo;s a must-visit attraction that combines breathtaking views with comfort and convenience.",05/10/2023,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-179259283?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

喜欢猫的虎,5.0,新加坡摩天轮的高度约为165米，相等于42层楼，是亚洲目前最高的摩天轮。28个安装了空调的座舱可以分别容纳28名乘客，也可以包厢独自与情侣享用摩天轮的丰盛餐点。旋转一周约用30分钟时间，不仅能够360&deg;鸟瞰新加坡的城市景观，还可以远眺直到约45公里外的景色。大楼中庭还有一座郁郁葱葱的热带雨林，雨林内的瀑布、小溪、岩石堆等绘成一幅幅供摄影的如画景观。,30/06/2023,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-177355317?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

史胖子,5.0,每次出去旅行只要有摩天轮我都会乘坐，亚洲最高观景摩天轮果然名不虚传！携程订票很方便，提前打印好预订单，加上预订人护照就可以在购票中心取票，不用排队哦~提前一点去，可以沿滨海湾散步，观落日，凉爽舒适，很多当地人在跑步、骑行。建议19:30登上摩天轮，既可以看到晚霞，又可观夜景，全程半小时，15分钟到达制高点，正好此时滨海湾公园上演灯光秀，拥有最佳视角。远眺鱼尾狮公园与金沙酒店，景致棒棒的！座舱很大，有座位，可以来回走动360度观景，玻璃擦的很干净，每次进入前都有工作人员打扫卫生，建议摄影带个小型支架哦，效果很赞！,26/02/2017,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-97964358?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
海蛇,5.0,也是标志性景点，坐上摩天轮可以把滨海湾的景色一览无余。特地选择晚上去乘坐摩天轮。地铁坐到宝门廊站，步行10分钟可以到达目的地。19：40分左右抵达景点，我们是现场买票，几乎没有等，直接就上去乘坐了。现场买票的时候，还看到儿童优惠，即有一名新加坡居民陪伴的小朋友可以免费乘坐。但是好可惜我们不是当地居民，所以没有享受到，还是乖乖买了门票。从售票处乘坐电梯按照指引来到了入口，在入口处会让你拍一张照片，然后结束的时候会问你要不要购买这个照片，价格是25新币。20：00不到一点，上了摩天轮。看着一点一点升高的轿箱，心情好激动。夜景非常美，几乎没有人坐在座位上，全都在拍照。差不多半小时左右，一圈就结束了。下来以后，是一个小吃街，对面是新加坡体育馆，也就是F1赛道。然后边上就是新加坡河。沿着河岸可以走到双螺旋桥，晚上灯光非常美丽。,20/08/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-86157887?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

蔡芷涵,5.0,新加坡摩天轮的设想首先产生于2000年，正式计划开始于2002年。德国Melchers项目管理公司（Melchers Project Management，MPM），东方和太平洋管理公司（Orient &amp; Pacific Management，O&amp;P）合资成立了名为新加坡摩天轮有限公司作为该项目的开发商。MPM和O&amp;P分别占股75%和25%。该项目正式公布后于2003年6月27日由新加坡旅游局批准并签订谅解备忘录，正式记录开发商与旅游局关于购地程序的协定。备忘录规定，旅游局将从新加坡土地管理局购买位于滨海中心的该地块并出租给新加坡摩天轮有限公司，租期30年，并可选择延长15年。此外，该地在项目施工期间旅游局将不收取租金。2003年7月，仲量联行被指定为该项目的不动产咨询顾问。竹中工程公司（Takenaka Corporation）和三菱重工被选为承建商，奥雅纳（Arup）负责结构工程研究和设计。摩天轮最初的设计类似伦敦眼，高度为170米，但被批评缺乏原创性。开发商很快回应称这一设计并非最终版本，只是用于概念构思用途。后来项目在开发中由于开发商筹措资金上的困难几乎陷于停顿，原计划于2005年底完工的摩天轮被无限期的拖延。2005年9月，项目得到两家德国银行注资&mdash;&mdash;Delbrueck Bethmann Maffei银行（荷兰银行的子公司）为项目提供1亿新元，裕宝联合银行提供1.4亿新元，项目由此得以复苏。,14/10/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-89914632?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

Shuying,4.0,新加坡是一个城市国家，并且是一个很小的城市国家，曾经出差来此周末无事的时候东西、南北两个方向上都步行横渡整个城市，也计划过环岛。所以，我想，在摩天轮上应该是可以真正而非号称鸟瞰新加坡的吧。没有登上过摩天轮，主要是兴趣不大，另外也是每次去新加坡都是九月份小长假前，F1期间摩天轮偶有停运。其实，摩天轮本身就是景观，站在远处，遥看，仰望摩天轮也是极美的。,03/10/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-138637865?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

阿悠麻麻,5.0,带着小朋友一起到新加坡旅行，旅行前有一个小愿望就是去坐新加坡飞行者摩天轮，从高处看新加坡的美景。我们事先在网上先购买好了门票，到了摩天轮后，在服务中心换票就可以了。这个摩天轮很高，据说是世界最高的摩天观景轮。摩天轮并非在一楼乘坐的，需要先上楼，然后排队进入。走进摩天轮后，才发现每个观景舱好大，像一辆小型的巴士，里面可以坐很多人。听从工作人员的指挥，根据不同的人数进入观景舱里，然后开启了这趟奇妙的摩天轮之旅。一进摩天轮，小朋友很兴奋，看着窗外的景色从你身边慢慢经过，又慢慢的变小。最后，当我们乘坐的摩天轮到最顶端的时候，看到了著名的帆船酒店，好像和它平行在一条线上，就在你的身边。因为乘坐那么大的摩天轮，哪怕在很高的地方，都没有感到很害怕，反而是更壮观、美丽了。,28/09/2018,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-156761793?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
荆晓晨,5.0,新加坡摩天观景轮又名飞行者摩天轮（英语：Singapore Flyer）是一个位于新加坡的巨型摩天轮。摩天轮的设计由奥雅纳和三菱重工承担。高165米相当于42层楼高，比英国伦敦的&ldquo;千禧眼&rdquo;还要高30米。第一次去新加坡的时候，匆匆路过。虽然第二次时间也不长，但摩天轮也放到了打卡地点中。在金沙湾结束了科学艺术博物馆之旅，顺便看了精彩的新加坡8月份国庆的彩排活动后，我们步行来到不远处的摩天轮，其实本来想坐在摩天轮上看烟花表演的，但是摩天轮排队时间长，所以没办法了！一楼买票，33元新币，普通包厢，里面可坐约10人，另外有VIP晚餐坐席。其实网上提前买便宜点。队伍真的很长，山路十八弯。排了近40分钟才轮到我们，快速上包厢。里面蛮宽敞。四面透明玻璃，中间两排沙发长凳。内部设有小屏幕播放新加坡经典景点介绍，包含了从摩天轮中目之所及的各个地标。转一圈约30分钟，可以看到由一盏盏霓虹灯构筑而成的繁华新加坡夜景，美不胜收。白天的话则有蓝色海景，兴许又是另一番美景，也许可以看到马来或印尼的小岛。165米也算挺高，不盯着脚底看的话倒还好。一切都好，就只除了包厢里几位叽叽喳喳分贝超高的中国小男孩。想着景色太好不发飙，提醒了也没有用。（虽然包厢里都是中国人，可是他们是不是也在其他地方丢脸了呢&hellip;&hellip;）论好好教育孩子的重要性。,10/09/2018,11,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-156604856?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

独行的蜗牛🐌,5.0,新加坡的景观摩天轮又叫飞行者摩天轮，据说有42层楼高，总高度达到了165米，从摩天轮上能够看整个城市，特别的壮观。转一圈下来大约需要37分钟，最好是傍晚的时候去，从天还亮，到转一圈变成夜景，非常的美丽，乘坐一次摩天轮，可以看到两种风景，很棒。,01/10/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-161240155?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

118***36,4.0,看景不如听景啦，不来坐一次也遗憾，坐一次，其实没有想象那么强烈。想象中可以看到滨海花园的灯光秀，但事实是距离太远了，只能看个轮廓，包括金沙都是一个轮廓，而且隔着玻璃，当然没有肉眼直接对着建筑物那么清晰。不过总体还是值得的，从另一个角度看。,14/08/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-160369270?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

M10***60,5.0,不错，值得一游。速度很慢，个人觉得非常平稳。慢慢升入高空，可以俯瞰周边的景色。只是网络购票的人比现场买的人还多，现场购票窗口，几乎不用排队，网络购票，换票排队大约30分钟，有点慢，需要带上购票人的护照,19/02/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-157953606?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
门头沟巴德,5.0,很好人不多，价格也不算贵。不过是白天去的，晚上去应该更美吧。离金沙酒店不太远，要过个桥。有时间的话晚上去一趟还是挺值的。,18/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-157947038?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
alex1700,4.0,新加坡摩天轮价格有点小贵，在诸多景点的门票中，感觉性价比不是很高。但是摩天轮的车厢设计，安全又平稳，连恐高的同伴也一点都不害怕，对着周围360度的美景一通狂拍。附近吃饭不太方便，摩天轮底下现在改名为美食街，但实际上原来路边摊的名字更贴切，只能随便吃吃吧！,16/02/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-157923245?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
M25***31,5.0,本来想下午六点多七点左右趁着夕阳去的，这个时候景色最好。结果飞机晚点导致八点左右才到，天已经黑了，只能看纯夜景，不过纯夜景也很美！人不多，不用排队，可能是比较晚了，加上是元旦后去，非节假日。携程订了票，直接在一楼兑换。刚到新加坡就去坐了摩天轮，体验还是很棒的！海滨金沙大酒店、巨树、花穹、云雾林、克拉码头、鱼尾狮（看不大清楚很小）基本地标都看到了。刚好遇到巨树8.45的灯光表演。但是没有现场看震撼。,06/01/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-157583497?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
Sunning,5.0,42层楼高的新加坡摩天轮的轮体直径达150米，安置在3层的休闲购物中心楼上，总高度达到165米。这一高度超过了160米高的南昌之星和130米的伦敦眼。28个安装了空调的座舱可以分别容纳28名乘客。摩天轮旋转一周约用30分钟时间。,02/01/2019,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-157558134?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
M13***07,5.0,换票很方便。我原以为摩天轮需要排很久的队，但事实上没有，作为亚洲最大的摩天轮，每一个座舱如一辆中巴车大小，可以容纳28人，但是由于游客不多，我们四个人就霸占了一个座舱，简直不要太爽。唯一遗憾的是今天天气阴，不能远眺马来西亚和印尼。,14/08/2018,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-156144152?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

Dudelsack,4.0,世界最大的摩天轮，还可以喝下午茶或者晚饭，当然，价格也是相当的辣手！一个轮子可以装10多个人，所以一点也不浪漫，可能吃吃晚饭，喝喝下午茶会好点！夜景超美的！不过玻璃反光，拍出来的照片，总会差那么一点点&hellip;转的不快，一圈大概25分钟这样。虽然和国内的不一样，不浪漫，但是没去过的，还是推荐去，因为夜景赞！携程买票子比较便宜！,07/06/2017,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-108982748?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer
626***12,4.0,带孩子们去的，晚上去灯火辉煌，风景很美。只是拍照效果不好，有些失望。直接购票大人33，小孩21，在网上购票会更便宜。到最高点时孩子还是会怕。出门取照片的地方依然纪念品，没有什么可买呢。下楼后的意大利不错，小朋友们不断竖起大拇指,29/01/2016,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-flyer-10758467-70479938?locale=en-SG,Singapore Flyer

lensy16,3.0,四个动物园联票优惠套餐。飞禽最近也搬到了一起，于是四个动物园就很近了，下地铁站坐动物园免费的shuttle就可以去四个动物园。夜间动物园需要预约，我们约的第一天晚上，约晚了，只有7:15入园的了，后来发现应该早点去，7:15分其实6点多也可以入园，这样可以在天黑之前看一些动物，因为里面很大，真的天黑了啥也看不清楚。而且我们当天小火车坏了，等了很久后面放弃选择了步行，但发现里面太大了，靠走的根本走不完，还是要坐小火车，小火车虽然有讲解，但距离动物有点远，晚上也看不清，所以感觉夜间动物园有点坑。而且很多动物园其实白天也能看到，不一定是晚上出来活动的，也许只是睡得晚而已。怕审美疲劳于是我们第一天早上去的是飞禽动物园，真的是bird paradise，最惊喜的是企鹅，里面有个很大的企鹅馆，里面的企鹅时刻准备跳水很萌。然后就是各种鹦鹉，而且因为不怕人会飞到你手上和你头上，鸟儿们在里面可真的是太快乐了。里面不大，建议可以看两个表演，都在同一个地方，不需要提前预约，看好时间提前进去可以坐好点的位子。因为我们想着到晚上去夜间动物园夜间动物园，所以在里面的星巴克吃了个晚饭。,01/01/2024,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-180272210?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

M46***93,5.0,作为所有景区里开门时间最早的，动物园作为早上下飞机后的第一站，还算比较节省时间，不过要计划好行李问题，最好寄存在酒店，如果在景区寄存行李需要收费，一共花了26新币略贵。园内有来自世界各地的各种各样的动物植物，虽然园区不大，但走走就很热了，可以坐一坐园区内的小火车，有四个站可上下，车上还有一些循环播放的英文介绍，讲解两边的园区。根据时间和天气园区里的表演可能会有调整，最好提前查看规划一下路线和顺序做到一个不落全都参与一下，表演都很有意思，每个表演都会在最后强调保护环境的问题，很有教育意义。游玩建议的话记得带雨伞防晒，吃喝可以略带一些轻便的。,14/11/2023,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-179787355?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Plenty of free water refill stations and no prohibition on bringing your own food into the zoo. The primate breeding started at 4.15 pm and the chimpanzee feeding at 4.30 p.m. was particularly entertaining and informative. Two public bus routes drop you at the zoo entrance.

putra jerumy,5.0,"The place and collection of animals are not as large or large as TSI Cisarua or Prigen, especially when compared to Batu Secret Zoo. but it&#39;s pretty good for family tourism. Buy tickets online, be smart, just look for promotions, prices are the same on weekdays or weekends, you can get free to ride the tram multiple times. Here the most interesting is the fragile forest area, where we can interact directly with small animals. For animal showtime, they take turns in one place, so that during the show the majority of visitors gather there. It&#39;s best to fill your stomach first if you want to visit early. The zoo opens at 8.30, but the food court only opens at 10. In the tourist area there are also several places to refill drinking water bottles.

202***68,5.0,四个动物园其实就是把一个大型动物园一拆四。动物园：环境绿化很好，哺乳类爬行类为主，有少量特有动物其余常规，半天足矣。河川园：水生类为主，有熊猫馆，全程有顶棚（除了漂流），下雨天时的好选择，漂流儿童向，一开始向上升一段，后分三次小降落，小朋友喜欢，基本不湿水，行程较短不尽兴，半天足矣。夜间：很有意思的体验，虽然黑不溜秋的看不清（俺近视），但还是值得一试，有些动物区域较臭，但忍下其实还好。小火车排队很长，得早点去，再吃点小吃看个表演，完美回家。飞鸟园：强烈推荐！每个区域都是大棚，各种鸟类在其间自由飞翔，有很多近距离观察互动的机会，自然感满满，鹦鹉区及湿地区最赞。对鸟类无感的估计半天足矣。俺一家逛了整整一天，企鹅馆很普通，其余馆值得好好逛逛！这个馆被低估了。几个园里对动物的介绍设置都很不错。,03/10/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-179234697?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

极光小鲸,5.0,新加坡的动物园生态环境相当好，而且日间动物园，河川生态园，夜间动物园都在一起，如果体力许可安排一天游览也绰绰有余。动物园整体设计还是比较考虑动物的生存环境的，没有看到过有动物刻板行为，我觉得比广场长隆做的更好。可以选择步行或坐浏览车观赏。新加坡动物园被誉为全世界最有特色的动物园之一。它采用了大量自然景物将动物和游客隔开，如溪流、石壁、植被等，使之成为一个开放的公园。在这里生活着3000多种动物，有马来虎、金色绢毛猴、猎豹和海狮等等。繁殖长臂巨猿的计划使这种濒临灭绝的动物在这里得以繁衍生息。此动物园的独特之处在于行走在其中就如行走在自然世界里，和动物们近距离接触。,06/06/2023,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-176067851?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Haohao Zhang,5.0,【热带雨林仙境-新加坡动物园！（附游玩攻略）】这里曾被评为全球前三的动物园之一。我想，不仅是因为这里的生态环境，更是动物园内对待动物的态度。走进园区，仿佛来到了苍翠繁茂的仙境，辽阔的天然围墙代替了传统动物园的&#39;&#39;牢笼&#39;&#39;。在这里，大部分动物是自由的，你可以和猩猩一起享用早餐，躲闪马来西亚狐蝠，与趴在树上的树懒玩耍，在路上偶遇蜥蜴出没爬行，甚至还可能会被头顶树枝上的小猴子吓一跳。走着走着，望着繁茂的绿植，数尺高的苍天大树，你甚至可能会忘了自己身在动物园中，仿佛原始森林探秘般。【精彩推荐】1.野趣早餐-与红毛猩猩共用早餐时间:上午9:00-10:30类型:自助餐价格:需额外收费，成人35新元（人民币约175），儿童25新元（人民币约125）。2.导览车时间:上午8:45-下午5:30价格:成人5新元（人民币约25），儿童3新元（人民币约15）这个导览车总共在园区停四站，分别为1234号导览车站，无限次乘坐，乘坐的时候沿途会有英文讲解。一定记得带一个圆孔插头的耳机，每个座位的前方都配备了同声翻译讲解器，插入耳机，频道调为中国，即可听到中文讲解了~,30/04/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-158590398?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
D调的华丽转身,5.0,新加坡动物园，在新加坡的北侧，如果要过去玩的话最好准备一天的时间，一方面因为所处的地理位置比较偏，单程车程就要消耗一个小时，此外园区也很大，除了看一个个展区的动物之外，还有提供不同时间段的表演，那么在不同展区看表演和等候的时间加起来至少需要一个半小时。此外，从新加坡动物园也可以到河川生态园和夜间动物园玩，到河川生态园步行约一分钟，到夜间动物园步行约三分钟，非常方便。乘车的话在红线的宏桥站下车，步行到公交总站，搭乘138可以到达，选择人下车最多的那个站点就是啦～动物园内只有一家吃的，就是KFC，一共有两处。在动物园的大门口有一家，在儿童乐园区里还有一家。但无论是哪处，生意都是爆好，都在排队。价格方面还算比较公道，和国内吃的差不多，会贵一点点，一个汉堡是3.30新币，套餐在10新币左右。点餐员大部分是可以说中文的，虽然有一些可能说得并不好，但是大概能点餐就行了，何况有提供菜单，就算不懂表示，直接指一指想要的菜品人家也能懂～两家KFC都有提醒牌标明cash only，所以来吃之前最好准备好现金。动物园进园分为现场购票，团队购票还有网络购票，现场购票比较麻烦，要排队，队伍也挺长的，消耗时间。如果是网络购票的亲，直接可以到售票厅右手边的绿色打印机上直接扫码出票，就算是网络购票也需要换乘纸质票才能进园哦～园区很大，在园区门口有地图，是一位男工作人员在发，地图里还有写各种表演的时间，不过地图并不是现场随便取，工作人员收在袋子里，你走过去他才拿出来，所以有些游客没看到就没拿了。表演大致是四场，大象表演，海豹表演，动物朋友，热带雨林。自己要算好时间错开来看。动物表演由于一些原因就没有去看了，剩下的三个表演才发现，都是同一个主持人&hellip;&hellip;不过地点不同。热带雨林和海豹表演是在同一个场馆的，大象在亚洲象展区。所有的表演全是采用英语，尤其是热带雨林，说的比表演多得多，比较郁闷&hellip;&hellip;海豹表演相当精彩，很好看。大象表演结束后有消费鸡蛋喂食大象的环节，要花钱，自愿。园区里有循环的观光车，车子来的很慢，相当于在园区里慢慢兜风，看看风景。上车之前有工作人员会经营验票，要把入园票给工作人员查验。车上有自动讲解，在比较大的展区前就会播放，如果有带上耳机的亲们，就可以将耳机插在前排背后的翻译机上，可以自己选择翻译语言。整个新加坡动物园的设计都特别的贴心，从在洗手间边上都有提供红外线的打水机，所以全程几乎都不用买水了，如果喜,11/08/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-118303116?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
_51***13,5.0,带了两个娃本身游览效率就不高，所以主要走了公园左侧这几个动物区域，看了比较多的灵长类动物。这里的生态环境真的很好，动物都有很大的活动空间，部分动物游客可以跟他们很近距离的接触，它们一点都不怕人，他们完全展示了自己最自然最舒服的一面。老实说如果抱着看表演为主的心态来玩，肯定会失望，这里有四个表演，都会有上午场和下午场，但是这里的动物并没有被训练去完成很高难度的动作，这里的表演主要是向游客介绍和展示部分动物的习性，特长和特点，完全没有我们平时国内看到的动物的高难度表演。有兴趣的可以看看动物喂食，蛮有意思的。需要提醒，门口牌子上表演的时间都不对了，请看我图一的时间。还要说说这里的环境真的很好，树木花卉品种丰富，自然景致也很美丽，真的是白送一个植物园。最后安利一下这里的水上乐园，孩子们真的都很喜欢，关键人家还不要钱。景区的食物，我今天中午吃了阿明，出园又出了KFC，我自己觉得还是KFC好吃一点。,02/08/2017,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-117100660?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

lzizs,5.0,新加坡有日间动物园、河川动物园、夜间动物园，三家挨着，此外还有飞禽公园，由于时间有限，最终还是比较后选择了日间动物园，动物种类更丰富、表演内容更丰富。从市区打车到动物园20块新币足够，动物园门票可以提前在网上买，还包含了小火车票，会发一个条码到邮箱，入园直接扫码进不用再换票，很方便价格也比现场买合适。我们的路线是：进门步行看了长鼻猴、白虎园、北极熊那片区域，然后从一号站坐小火车到二号站，沿途可以看到长颈鹿、犀牛等动物，下车走到地图最上方的儿童乐园，哪里有小矮马可以让孩子骑，也可以喂兔子喂小羊，还有旋转木马等适合孩子的项目，如果玩嬉水乐园的话要提前带着泳衣。之后走回二号站坐车到四号，步行去看大象表演，最后再走回出口。因为才去了珠海长隆，所以舍弃了海洋动物表演，下午又赶上下雨，在倭海马那个展区歇了会，整体来说只参观了2/3不到，出门已经到了闭园时间。尽管有一阵雨很大，但动物园的设计很合理，雨水都会顺着坡道溜走，路面不会有积水，很多步行区域也有长廊既遮阳又防雨。建议去动物园还是要留够一天时间仔细玩玩。因为当晚要去圣淘沙入住，再加上怕孩子坚持不了一天，所以没有去夜间动物园，如果是成人去可以把夜间一起玩了。最大的问题还是打车，预约车在出租车下客点那一侧等候，基本不排队，普通车的上车点在日间动物园和夜间动物园之间，排队排了至少一个小时，人多车少，建议去时提前订好车，或者坐公交回来，公交车班次很多还基本能保证座位。对比新加坡动物园和广州长隆动物园、大连野生动物园、成都大熊猫基地，新加坡动物园面积应该是最小的，但是设计相对合理，展区比较紧凑，除了动物一些热带植物也有介绍，相关配套也比较完善，还是很适合亲子出行的！,29/02/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-71309462?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

带着俩娃走天下,5.0,新加坡动物园，绝对算得上是新加坡亲子打卡的必到之处。这座在自然保护区中修建而成的动物园，与河川生态园和新加坡夜间野生动物园毗邻，多年来连续被评为世界十佳动物园，最佳亲子景区等等，可谓拿奖拿到手软。动物园设计之初就秉承开放式理念，全浸入式的参观体验，让人仿佛置身于动物们生活的世界，但却完全不被打扰。走在其中，不经意间便会有各种小动物与你来一次美丽的邂逅，可爱的小动物们真的是让孩子们毫无抵抗力。        新加坡动物园另一大特色就是极强的科普性，在这里，除了针对小龄段孩子们设计的互动展区外，还专门针对上学的孩子设立科普展区，将动物科普，生态保护等知识通过直观体验的方式向学生们进行展示，非常受学生们的欢迎。行走在动物园中，经常能够看到成群结队的当地中小学生来到园内进行互动参观学习，给孩子们提供了课外实践的绝佳机会。此外，每天固定时间段还会有相应的动物生活习性展示，饲养员会根据小动物们的日常生活习惯和规律向游客们进行讲解，并且还能跟自己喜欢的小动物来一次亲密接触，真的是非常棒的互动体验。        另外要提醒大家的是带孩子的朋友们一定记得来新加坡动物园要给宝宝带上泳衣。什么？你没有听错！就是泳衣！园内除了1200多只野生动物外，还建有一个水上乐园，孩子们在参观动物的途中，还能够在水上乐园里面休息玩耍，最重要的是完全不需要单独额外收费，孩子们真的是玩high了！,26/03/2020,11,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-163113226?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
考拉羊洋,5.0,新加坡动物园作为世界十大动物园之一，采用全天开放式的模式，利用热带森林和湖泊等天然屏障代替栅栏，让动物门在纯天然的环境下繁衍生息。在没有了冰冷的铁笼和铁栏的束缚，动物有了充足的生活空间，并且游客也可以近距离的与动物接触，漫步在树林下，抬头可见攀爬而过的猩猩，猴子，真正达到了人与自然和平共处。动物园中有不少的珍禽异兽，如白老虎，马来貘和黑豹等，不仅如此，新加坡动物园还为小朋友甚至成年人提供了更多的互动类项目，从中游客可以学习到许多动物的知识和加强野生动物的保护意识。就在不久前，新加坡动物园唯一的一只北极熊Inuka去世了，也成为了当时新加坡的头条新闻，这次去游玩的时候，北极熊馆已被纪念Inuka的大幅海报所遮盖，但仍有不少前来悼念的新加坡人送上鲜花和纪念卡片，让人甚是动容。,10/08/2019,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160230486?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Agatha81,4.0,新加坡日间动物园，面积虽然不能说非常大，但物种挺丰富，最重要的是人与自然和动物和谐一体，亲密接触。一进大门就有一只调皮的猴子挤眉弄眼看着游客，可以拍照但不能靠近，非常凶白老虎慵懒的趴在石头上；正在行走会突然出现动物，要么在路边树林闲逛，要么在游人面前大摇大摆走着。蝴蝶馆里游客可以直接和蝴蝶亲密接触，蝴蝶甚至会停到游人身上扑闪翅膀。动物园里定点有动物表演，不过是纯英文的[捂脸]大狐蝠就在游客面前大吃特吃，伸手就可以摸到它们，时不时路边钻出几只动物，吓人一跳整个动物园最怡人之处就是没有觉得它是一个被圈起来的动物园[奸笑]动物园最里边有一个儿童游乐区，在驯马区1.2米以下儿童可以骑马玩，一次6新元，非常便宜，有专人带领牵马；旋转木马一次4新元，水上游乐区免费，对孩子十分友好[奸笑]在携程订了门票，可以在门口自助机上直接换票进入，很方便。园内有接驳车，共有四个上下点，体力好的话建议全程步行，可以近距离观测很多动物。临出园门前，一条一米多长的大蜥蜴从我们面前悠哉悠哉地爬了过去。,10/09/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160867677?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
,4.0,日间动物园，夜间动物园，还有新开的River Safari，都在一片区域，不过一天都玩下来太辛苦了，而且容易审美疲劳，所以建议分开两天，夜间动物园单独一晚，日间和river一天。临近11点才到公园，人竟然也不多，总之这次来新加坡，去各种公园都有包场的feel。和飞禽公园不同，日间动物园的动物还是很具攻击性的，所以拍照不要靠太近为好！终于看到了科莫多龙和孟加拉白虎，超开心！river Safari真的强烈建议去，海底森林水族馆很具视觉冲击力，而且那个河道游船虽然很短，可却是真真实实热带雨林的feel，很绝妙的体验，不容错过！river Safari的门票包括了游船河，不过有两种选择，一种是水上热带丛林另外一种是水域风景，强烈建议热带丛林，因为这样才能看到全部的动物。,12/12/2015,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-68891415?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

VV云云,5.0,无论是圣淘沙的s.e.a.还是动物园，与国内的长隆相比，规模上都会显得逊色。但他们各有特长，绝对不会失望。如果时间充裕，还是很不错的亲子公园。动物园有两种儿童车出租：普通婴儿车和小船车，这种小船式的很特别，90元人民币租一天，小土孩毫不犹豫地要了这台。辛苦了爸爸，当了一路人力船夫，衣服湿透又被晒干。动物园的动物并不算多，走一圈的话，半天足够。比较有趣的是大家表演和猴子喂食，还有些突然在你身边出现的小动物，叫上出名字，但算是一处惊喜。新加坡动物园唯一不足之处就是交通不便。公交车要半小时一班，的士车严重不足，至少要排队20分钟，午后的等候时间更加漫长。如果有当地的专车软件，打辆专车来接是最省时的。由于交通原因，打乱了我们回市区吃饭的计划，只能以KFC随便一顿了。小土孩第一次吃KFC，开心极了。,07/03/2018,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-153746358?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Anonymous User,1.0,携程app购票后，按照要求的步骤预约3号门票，其中一张已被预约为6号，因为第二天就要去游玩，联系携程一直没有得到解决办法，只说给我们反映一下情况。第二天我们直接到达动物园，自行与工作人员沟通，才得已进园。怀疑携程发错核实码给我们，又无法取消订单从新预约，服务滞后。,19/08/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-178499241?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Racheldiaryjourney,5.0,"Amazing! the best Zoo I have ever visited! So many animals, the layout of the parks are designed fabulously! There are four parks in total, Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Night Safari and birds park. The first three parks are all located in the same area! The biggest park is the Singapore zoo and you can spend one day just on that park, however, We managed to finish all 3 parks in a full day! Staring from 9:00 am to 10:30 pm. They are huge with lots of different wild animals. The birds park is located somewhere else and you need to take a transport to get there. The Night Safari, has two routes one with Safari and one you just take a walk which you will see different animals in each route.The panda is located in River Wonders park.I would highly recommend visiting all parks if you are a visitor like me!there is a lot activity so it&rsquo;s recmmmended to visit the park early",13/01/2022,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-169114075?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

丫妈,4.0,新加坡动物园采用全开放式的模式，是世界十大动物园之一。园内利用热带森林与湖泊等天然屏障代替栅栏，使我们可以不受铁笼的遮栏而看得一清二楚，各类动物在没有人为屏障的舒适环境下过著自由自在的生活，与游客和平共处。入园后记得向工作人员要地图（非常重要，有中文版）地图非常清晰直观的标明了各种动物的所在区域及动物表演的时间地点。拿到地图后应该合理规划下游览线路，以及要观看表演的时间。我们在这点上就疏忽了，首先没有规划好先去哪里，再者大家进到里面都有些兴奋，因为随处可见的小动物悠闲的在马路上散步或一抬头在头顶的树梢上又会有新发现，所以任由自己随处逛了起来。这场大象表演我们提前半小时过去可人还是满了，不让进了，只得在背后观看了这场表演，可见人真不少。吸取教训，下一个海洋动物表演我们提早了一个小时到达，还好人不多，找了位子坐下，一边休息，一边可以去门口吃饭。有惊无险的日间动物园愉快的结束了。出来后我们马上转战夜间动物园门口去排队。这是是世界上第一间专为夜间动物设立的野生动物园。人真多，旅行团也多。七点半准时开门，一进入大门看到乘坐小火车前排起的长龙，我们果断放弃，直奔夜间精灵演出剧场。离得不远，是室外的。工作人员会带着动物出其不意的出现在观众席上，还会邀请观众上台互动，我们这场就请了个日本小伙子，这个年轻人很配合也很搞笑。,29/04/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-74791834?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

M53***47,5.0,虽然全园不算大，也没有上坡和台阶，但景观非常好，每一处都有一块小造景，拐弯处的小喷泉，指路标上的小动物，把动物布置的很有趣味。 携程的票用起来很方便，买票处旁边直接取票，票里已经包含了小火车，可以无限次坐小火车。我们带孩子最后坐小火车又兜了两圈。买两张成人票可以换购一张相片，正好小盆友最喜欢大象，要和合影，这样几乎免费照了一张，小盆友好开心！非常好用！！,04/09/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-121131470?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M35***29,5.0,真的是特别值得去，特别是带孩子的朋友们，结结实实的能玩一天。里面的小动物们比较多，虽然数量上可能不如国内，但是一个个小家伙们都生龙活虎的。有专门的儿童区，把小动物们领出来让孩子们摸摸，特别的治愈。强烈告诫各位，门口一定要领地图，不然经常要走回头路。,27/08/2017,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-119890708?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
远行-遇见你,5.0,大概沿着走廊五分钟即可到达。在日间动物园闭园之后可以在门口的小餐馆就餐，有KFC和各种小吃，也可以去夜间动物园的大门口有很多商店。园区内居住着超过2500只动物，游人在宽阔的自然栖息地中观察夜行动物的行踪。在45分钟的行程中，游客乘坐游览车，穿梭于世界7个不同地理区域！垫一下回市区里吃也是可以哒。夜间动物园一样有两种游玩方式，步行和缆车，但是还是做缆车游玩，一整圈大概在40分钟左右，车上有讲解的广播，在每一个动物前车子会慢慢开给你足够的时间观赏动物，因为保护动物夜间动物园里面路灯很少都是黑黑的，所以总觉得走步道很可怕，因为坐车子的时候真的马来貘和小鹿就在步道旁边溜达，太开放了有没有。,18/08/2017,12,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-119675864?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
无非子,5.0,乘坐地铁宏茂桥站换乘公交138，就能直达动物园景区，本以为河川生态园很小很不经晃，没想到晃了近四个小时还意犹未尽。园内还有游览船可乘，我们选择了亚马逊漂流，短短的一刻钟也体验到了与众不同。夜间动物园必须要买中文小火车，即使你没换到19:15的入场券，也可根据预定的中文火车的时间从旁边乘坐小火车的侧门进去。不然的话入大门要等，里面的免费小火车也要等，这前等后等估计没个3小时是搞不定的。19:00先大门口看一场土著喷火表演，接着直接拿火车票去侧面排队（我预约了19:45的中文小火车，所谓的中文小火车就是火车上有可调节的语言解说），时间刚刚好。夜间动物园除了坐火车听讲解外，还可以自己步行小径去找动物，和另外两个动物演出。由于孩子们都累了，乘好火车就直接打道回府了。虽然游览时间不长，但还是看到了不少动物，尤其是上次没看到的长颈鹿（宝对长颈鹿有着莫名的执念，到哪动物园都得找它，上次没找到这次圆了）。还看到了马来西亚的土著物种马来貘，圆滚滚的一头，有猪的既视感，又有点像象，但人家可是跟犀牛和马是近亲。好吧，黑漆漆的啥照片都没有，大家以后亲身去体验吧。,02/08/2017,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-117095810?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
669***07,5.0,从滨海广场打车过去20元新币，司机说因为周末，高速不收费，所以周末打车去还是很合算的。整个动物园都很干净，有个儿童嬉水乐园，很不错，建议大家一直要带好小朋友的泳衣泳裤。边上有卖水上装备的，发现哈瓦那的儿童拖也就25新币，比国内便宜！,28/07/2017,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-116727232?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
_ZF***90,5.0,新加坡动物园，这完全就是一个热带雨林公园，利用天然的屏障代替传统的栅栏，跟各种动物们来一次亲密接触，相比通常的动物园，这里动物的生存环境更自然一点，表演主要有大象表演，热带雨林小动物表演，以及其他一些喂食表演。园里的票含小火车，（好像另有一种低价票不含小火车）但是人多时候需要排5~10分钟等待上车。另外难得的是园里还有个戏水公园，有大型的玩具城堡和各种喷水装置，小朋友玩的很开心。动物园位置比较偏，打车到滨海湾大约18新币。,16/06/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-74678542?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

tangbei78,5.0,新加坡的动物园不大，和广州的长隆一个风格，但新加坡的动物园给我的印象非常深刻的是动物的生态饲养：企鹅馆挨着海豹池，池子上面还养着鹈鹕，特别和谐。你在路间走，长臂猿就在你的头顶穿越，很自然！中午在动物园里的餐厅吃的，价钱是平价，不像我们国内的公园内的吃喝都是涨了好几倍的，中午吃饭的人很多，要排队，点了她们的咖椰味的海鲜米粉，有椰奶味，吃不惯，海南鸡饭依然好吃！,03/03/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-71370434?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

M33***26,5.0,动物园的布景很棒，但部分线路为了节约占地面积，导致识别困难，规划不合理，容易走错。动物园的环境还是非常赞，园区四周的森林和河道也非常原生态。在新加坡这样的地方，能有这么大的森林覆盖难能可贵。，。,08/05/2020,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-163406991?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

205***66,5.0,新加坡动物园环境超级好，动物们的居住在天然氧吧里，环境让人羡慕。第一次近距离看了油亮亮肉墩墩的河马🦛，身体线条超优美的豹子🐆，树林里的大猩猩🦧和小猴子🐒，小溪里筑家的水獭🦦，看到了巨大的龟🐢，饲养员姐姐含情脉脉地给大龟搔痒、拥抱、呢喃，特别温情。小剧场里分时段还有不同的动物表演，小朋友玩的非常开心，回北京后依然念念不忘。,08/05/2020,7,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-163404316?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

超级ctt,4.0,距离离市区有点远，所以打车或者地铁都可以。 动物很多，都是一些热带动物，在中国国内不常见，所以很新奇。 动物的表演都很可爱，也很值得一看，整个园区非常大，如果想整个细致玩的可能需要一天时间。 园内的食物还不错，价格适中。动物园的花花门口好漂亮是必到的打卡位。园内有提供儿童车仔，方便父母拉着走。也有提供－人电动车比行动不便的客人。园内也有供客人喂饲指定动物，不过需另行收费。坐游园车可周围游园，盖了手印，可无限次乘搭。,27/02/2020,14,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-162911984?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
快乐酷酷王子,5.0,物超所值的动物园，比在新加坡这样一个消费很贵的地方，动物园的门票显然十分便宜了。非常有趣的动物，非常好的服务，景区内的食物价格也跟市区基本一致，推荐一玩，入园时一定要让安检小哥哥小姐姐盖小火车的章，小火车值得体验，但是路程不远，走路就可以完成。,08/02/2020,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-162813432?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
辉哥_,4.0,新加坡动物园离市区有点距离，听说快接近马来西亚了。动物园不算大，小火车开一圈很快，而且火车上看不到什么景点。还有这里的动物种类并不多，主要看猩猩和猴子，北极熊几年前就不在了，但场馆还空在那里。剧场表演也很简单，总体来说比长隆差太远了。,05/02/2020,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-162797860?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Jessie,5.0,Me and my family had a great time visiting the Singapore Zoo. Even though its raining we had a chance to explore around with the help of the tram and walkways with a shed.

M22***11,5.0,新加坡动物园真的是野生动物园，需要根据牌子找动物，因为树木太茂盛了，有时候找不到。在这里可以看到很多国内看不到的动物，比如非洲企鹅，红毛猩猩。介绍有的有中文名字有的没有，估计没有的就是国内没有，人家不知道怎么翻译，动物园里还有儿童嬉水游乐场。动物园设施很好，卫生间比较多，还有接热水的地方，总之玩儿起来体验很好？,15/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160937972?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
武襄子,5.0,当时上午11点多到的，游览顺序是先日间动物园，再河川动物园，晚上去的夜间动物园。日间动物园要提前做好路径规划，尽量不要走回头路，里面有2，3个吃饭的地方，不过个人感觉肯德基最好。白老虎难得一见，值得看一看，还有很多热带动物，比如中国神话中的食梦兽貘，也很可爱。河川动物园有个收费的Amazon quest很不错，会坐船看动物。夜间动物园墙裂推荐，国内不常见专门的夜间动物园，很多夜行动物。可以坐着小火车看，然后再步行游览,12/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160889622?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M34***67,5.0,上周第一次参观了这间动物园，超爱这里的! 动物园采取全开放模式，我很喜欢这种感觉，园区里的动物们比网站上展示的还多，这是另一个意外惊喜。如果来的时机合适，一定要参加飞溅狩猎（Splash Safari） - 海狮Phillip真是太可爱了!,10/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160865505?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M34***34,5.0,很有趣，动物品种很多，区域分布也比较合理，印象最深的是脆弱森林，可以跟小动物亲密接触，唯一遗憾的是目前新加坡是雨季，下午下了一场大雨，公园工作人员很贴心，用小车把我们送到出口处不远，下次来新加坡的时候肯定会再去。,10/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160866202?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M33***63,5.0,设计独特的动物园，它用聪明和天然的方法让我们能够近距离观察动物。而动物们又好像受过训练般不害怕人类。 我们很享有这个旅程！公园的员工也有礼貌且有效率。 只闪离开闽很多人，建议事先找出租车，否则要恭很久时间才能回到市区,09/09/2019,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-160853603?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Ama Beebee,5.0,Loved it so much. All the animal shows were spectacular. There are many exotic animals and wild plants. Interesting place to go with your family...its unfortunate I went alone but was still very interesting and adventurous. The Night Safari was out of the world fantastic.

joan15t,5.0,很不错的动物园，虽然不大，但是设计理念非常好，真的是让人感觉人与自然的和谐。园内的孔雀随处可见，长这么大，我也还是第一次这么近地观察蝙蝠，看它吃东西真有意思。园内的餐厅定价也还可以，我吃了海南鸡饭9.9新币，儿子吃了海南咖喱鸡面7.9新币，跟园区外差不多。公共交通很方便，地铁下来就有穿梭巴士直接到动物园，很不错的一次体验体验。,16/07/2019,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-159770560?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
203***33,5.0,小巧精致的一个动物园，动物都是散养在里面的，关于动物表演，全程英语讲解！而且动物表演的项目也都是比较简单的项目，大象表演除非能听懂英语讲解，不然看一会就可以了，飞禽表演千万别坐在绳子下面，不然搞不好就屎从天降。动物园全程有小火车可以做，分4个站，推车是拖拉的操控性一般，人多的时候容易撞上别人，而且整个园区也不大。和长隆对标，我个人的评价是各有特色！小朋友爱看动物园！红线地铁坐到卡迪站，出站左转在左转，就是接驳巴士点，15分钟一班非常方便。地铁站一楼有个超市，可以补充装备，出门往前100米就是接驳车停靠点，非常方便！,13/07/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-159722203?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
juki235,5.0,新加坡动物园是新加坡四大动物公园之一，他也是亚洲著名的动物园。整个动物园虽然面积不大，但是设计的非常精巧，弥补了空间上的不足。这里饲养着许多来自世界各地的珍稀动物，有些动物都是自由散养的，非常的新奇，这在国内的动物园是不大多见的。在这里你可以深切的感受到人与动物的和谐共处，参观完动物园，感想颇多真的是不虚此行。,10/06/2019,14,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-159250426?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
人生如梦91,5.0,打车到了新加坡动物园，当时新加坡动物园买票的人挺多的就在携程上买了票，售票处旁边就有自助取票机人也不少，有当地人帮助取票，也挺快的，然后迅速入园，动物园里面挺大的也挺干净，像是在一个大公园里面，规划的挺好的，里面也有电瓶车可以到每一个景点，完事到市区吃了顿海鲜挺不错的，值得推荐！出来后老爸给儿媳妇买了个LV手提包，那是真心的贵呀！,10/06/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-159246731?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
大苹果带着小苹果,5.0,日间动物园很好玩，可以和小动物近距离接触，夜间动物园不推荐，首先一大部分是和动物园重叠，第二，晚上黑漆漆没有灯真的什么都看不见！ 去一个日间动物园足够了！第六张图是夜间动物园拍的... 什么都看不到.....,05/06/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-159182379?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
_qc***38,5.0,白天去过了，而且是二刷了，所以夜晚再去走起来孩子不会因为天黑很害怕。灯光秀做得小巧，但是每一处还是比较有新意的。虽然是限流分场次的，但是因为地方小，每一波人集中在一个区域里，想做体验也还是要稍等排队的。最喜欢那个蹦跳的环节（大名儿没记住）和最后用入门时领的手环去战队拍照上传的环节，类似于樟宜机场那个社交树。携程出票很快，用起来也方便，还是专场可以第一拨入园，然后携程还经常会在买票的时候推荐一些象征性收费（毛八分的）赠品券，好评！,09/05/2019,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-158746646?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M30***90,5.0,提前在网上定好的门票，到了动物园门口的自助机器上就可以扫码换票，大家记得如果定了夜间动物园或者河川生态园以及晚餐的，一起在自助机器上换好哦，因为售票点和自助机器都在日间动物园门口，一次性换好就不用来回跑了~~,19/04/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-158467396?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M10***60,5.0,需要排队扫条码取票，还是比较方便，不用打印，我是把邮件截图，保存在相册里，再扫码的。里面环境很好！动物嘛，感觉都差不多，觉得二者很相似，但个人觉得表演还不如长隆。但是新加坡动物园的环境绝对要更上一筹！因为时间关系，儿童乐园没有去，无从知晓。,19/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157954069?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
saisay,5.0,地方不是很大，带着孩子玩一天正好。园内外的用餐价格一致，无需等到出园，随时在园内用餐（人均10新元）。园内指示标志明显，很好找。另外还有儿童游乐区域（需要额外买票才能玩），尤其是水世界（免费），孩子喜欢玩，记得带上泳衣！如果想看更多的动物，需要选择喂食时间段去看，这样会很过瘾。,14/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157910478?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
Ar光,5.0,动物园精致好逛，植被众多，犹如置身森林之中。动物表演看到了白孔雀开屏，难得一见。这白殿下足足开了几十分钟，节目完结了还在台上亮相。动物种类也比较齐全，小孩子逛也不会太累。最主要干净，我这个招惹蚊子的人居然没在公园里被蚊子咬到。公园餐饮还不错，就是海南鸡饭提早卖完了。我们一家都喜欢吃白切鸡类型的禽肉菜品。,11/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157861033?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
_We***67,5.0,携程买票出票快，换票容易，扫码出票，动物园不太大，其实就日间动物园来说不如长隆，不过三个动物园一起逛的话还是值得一去的，日间动物园是我去的第一个动物园，本想一早八点半就去，一天逛三个，结果起晚了，十点多才到，事实证明，十点多到逛三个也没什么问题，本以为会逛很久，租了个推车15新币，结果两点多就还了，所有动物都看到了，还有一小片热带水果种植园，我们没坐观光车，动物都懒洋洋的没什么野性，还发现了一个跑出来的蜥蜴，交通的话地铁卡迪站有穿梭巴，一个人一新币,01/02/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157749148?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
_We***82,5.0,离市区比较远，要坐地铁到宏贸桥，再做138，里面比较大，动物们生存环境非常好，如果再去河川的话，需要早点到，开园就进吧，我们去的晚一些，到了都十一点半了，下午又下雨了，所以没去上河川，新加坡下雨特别急，但可能二十几分钟就停了，雨伞必备,17/01/2019,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157650060?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
Eileenhh,5.0,Best zoo experience ever!! 很多动物都没有被关在笼子里的，人可以超近距离接触到它们～ Night Safari有点可惜，只坐小火车半个小时转了一圈，结束后想去看一个show但是已经满员了，建议想看show的话就先去看然后再去坐小火车～ 整体来说非常好的体验！,12/01/2019,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157618883?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
善了哉的,5.0,星期天去新加坡动物园，据说被评为是世界十大动物园之一。动物园占地28.3公顷，采用全开放式的模式，但又与国内的开放式动物园所不同，这里园内以天然屏障代替栅栏，尽量模拟了动物们栖息的天然环境。不同于国内动物园里动物的懒散，这里的动物显得很活泼可爱，也许他们觉得生活在这里也是一种幸福吧。我觉得，这个动物园动物的品种、质量和数量比国内的大型动物园都要多，而且有很多濒临灭绝的品种。这么大的动物园，显得有人依旧很多，但管理和服务都很好，游客的素质也都很高，这是我们国内应该学习的地方！,12/11/2018,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157196955?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
关裕年guanyunian,5.0,借他的吉言，十二年后，我果然带着太太和孩子来了，给她们的印象如何，就看看女儿的游记吧。这次我去新加坡，看见地面十分干净，导游（王胖胖）告诉我们，新加坡的人如果随地扔垃圾，就把他带到管理部门，然后，罚1000多新元，（相当于2000多块人民币），最后给他们穿上后背写有&ldquo;垃圾虫&rdquo;的背心，每天早上扫大街。,10/11/2018,15,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-157181978?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

pxy0705,5.0,新加坡动物园是我去过的最好玩的动物园，这里的动物实在是太多了，而且很多都是野生放养。比如动物园的树上就是猴子，可以自由的活动。还有精彩的大象表演，特别受游客的欢迎，整个动物园是个环形设计，大家可以乘坐游览车，游玩每一个地方十分的方便。另外还有儿童水上世界，小朋友可以在这里尽情的嬉戏，十分的充满童趣。,06/07/2018,14,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-155530030?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
M26***20,5.0,适合带孩子去，是一个很热带雨林风格的动物园。新加坡除了大夏天干燥，平时是个多余的季节，在动物园的一个上午绝对体会到了雨林感，还不错的.早上去与红毛猩猩一起吃早饭，别样的体验，特别喜欢小猩猩，所以很喜欢。吃的东西就一般吧，特色在红毛猩猩，吃的就成次重点了。既然要去动物园，那体验一次也是值得的！毕竟价格也不是很高。,05/05/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-154727787?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
bun***26,5.0,一进门很多小动物就在身边自由的活动，这点非常好。整个园不是很大，根本不需要一天时间，3、4个小时足够了。动物也没国内长隆多，总体没有长隆好玩。园内有免费的小火车，上下都很方便，有很多站点上下车。在携程订的票因为没用国内手机，不能收短信，是用收到的邮件在动物园右手边的机器自己取票的，要是能直接刷就更方便了。,05/04/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-154269123?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo
D99***85,5.0,很不错的一次体验，不光孩子喜欢，我们大人也觉得不虚此行。新加坡动物园坐落在热带雨林地区，开放式的管理理念，很多动物和人类只用栅栏分隔，很多食肉动物的&ldquo;领地&rdquo;就用一条河分隔，真怕它们窜出来。我们看到了在空地上闲庭信步的孔雀，自由爬行的蜥蜴，树间穿行的猴子，希望有机会下次再去玩儿,01/04/2018,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-154198147?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

就叫小筷子吧,5.0,来新加坡玩动物园是必去景点之一，三岁娃就没考虑夜间动物园。日间动物园在郊区，七个人打车不划算，坐的动物园直达专线也比较方便。新加坡动物园与国内动物园比最大的不同在于动物不是关在笼子里，而且用各种树木小水塘之类的景观隔离，拉近了游客与动物的距离。镇园之宝红毛猩猩就在头顶上跳跃，非常有意思。,07/09/2017,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-121199261?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

走路快,5.0,动物园是比较著名的景点，周末游人很多。动物大多在散养状态，没有一般动物园常见的铁栅栏，感觉比较自然原生态。有一些不太常见的热带动物，长相比较奇特。动物园比较大，可以购买交通车票，在景点之间乘车。不过如果不想错过什么动物，还是步行比较靠谱。动物园重点动物红毛猩猩受到特别优待，在园中心位置占了一大块地方，但是不怎么活泼。印象比较深的是热带雨林园，在一个巨型网罩里面，可以近距离观察蝙蝠，还有地面行走的奇怪动物。遗憾的是寒带动物比较少，大概是因为维护成本比较高。除了参观动物，还有定时动物表演，表演时刻在园门口发的小册子上有标注。整个园子完全步行，慢慢转下来大约需要大半天。,05/02/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-96710152?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Nancy,5.0,我从没见过不在笼子里的动物，新加坡动物园没有把动物关在笼子里，不知道他们是如何设计的，有绿化带和河沟分开游客和动物，游客既能近距离看动物，动物又有自己的活动空间。感觉动物仍旧在野外而不是一个动物园。而不像笼子里的动物死气沉沉。大猩猩都可以在你上方跳来跳去又不会下来惊扰游客。带孩子去最好了。,02/07/2016,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-81632693?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

俺村我最俊,5.0,新加坡动物园的环境真的很好，很干净，也没有动物的异味飘散。整个动物园可以说就是半敞开式的，只要是对人类没有生命威胁的动物都是和游客几乎零距离的。像这种猴子所处的树就是游客触手可及的，猴子和游客之间是没有铁丝网之类的东西阻隔的。动物园里的袋鼠是一大亮点。这个馆里有一个巨大的玻璃墙可以看袋鼠，但是最让我们意外的是走出玻璃墙区域发现有一大片袋鼠自由活动的区域，而这片区域是游客走出袋鼠管的必经之路，游客的步行道只有非常低矮的一个木条象征性地竖在那里，从这点可以看出新加坡动物园对于人与动物之间的互动是做得非常好的。,11/10/2018,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-156952112?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

Yuna是一颗洋芋艿,5.0,新加坡动物园给我的总体印象是友善，把动物们的居住环境放在第一位。整个动物园的绿化覆盖面积非常大，对于园区设计更多的是生态和谐，特别是为动物们创造了舒适且自由自在的栖息条件，游客来到这里不是参观，更像是融入。用开玩笑的话说，当时我在游览的时候还以为来到了生态植物园。园区其实不大，时间充裕的话没必要做游览车，完全可以以散步的方式逛完整个园区。最后友情提醒一下，为了能节约时间不排长队，最好先在网上把票买好，现场买的话队伍还是蛮长的，而且网上买有折扣。,11/03/2018,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-153807280?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

浮云与流水,5.0,动物园在新加坡北边的郊区，单程一小时才到，但意犹未尽。整个动物园就是一片热带雨林改造而成，环境非常的好，游客能够距离较近的观察各类动物，里面动物种类也比较丰富，出了科莫多龙，还近距离看到了西部响尾蛇，这和用宠物黄金蟒充数的北京动物园相比，简直太良心了。另外里面动植物虽然多，但非常干净，很少见苍蝇等蚊虫，非常适合年轻的父母带宝宝去。,11/09/2017,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-121260227?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

tangbei78,4.0,吃过早餐直接下楼坐地铁到宏茂桥站，再到对面的公交车总站坐138路公交车去动物园，从头坐到尾，终点站下就是动物园，日间和夜间是挨着的。新加坡的动物园不大，和广州的长隆一个风格，但新加坡的动物园给我的印象非常深刻的是动物的生态饲养：企鹅馆挨着海豹池，池子上面还养着鹈鹕，特别和谐。你在路间走，长臂猿就在你的头顶穿越，很自然！中午在动物园里的餐厅吃的，价钱是平价，不像我们国内的公园内的吃喝都是涨了好几倍的，中午吃饭的人很多，要排队，点了她们的咖椰味的海鲜米粉，有椰奶味，吃不惯，海南鸡饭依然好吃！,28/02/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-zoo-76136-71682453?locale=en-SG,Singapore Zoo

_TI***b7,5.0,Purchase the tickets at Level 1 @ Tower 3. $22/person. Took the lift up to 56 floors. Exit the lift there is a small open area for picture taking before going into the restaurant. It was a week day and the crowd was small. Able to get a seat right by the window. Order some drinks and snacks and was able to use the ticket price as credit for the bill. The view was fantastic.

Unfortunately there was some works being done so we couldnt get to the tip of the &quot;boat&quot;. Luckily it was very empty ?Coronavirus caused it but we were grateful. We were then shown up to level 57 where we had a drink in the bar, but we had mixed messages as to this, someone said that was for an extra ticket holder so we dont know whether the lift guy got us confused with someone else.

FOR 700 ml water bottle. disappointing for photography lovers is no tripods allow, camera allowed only no extra charge for camera. once you go up there then no tile limit for exit so enjoy fully and if you are hurry for next attractions then its your choice bcz down at garden by the bay there is night sound and light show.",01/09/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/sands-skypark-15131377-178745968?locale=en-SG,Skypark

山水人生,5.0,下午我们搭乘公交车前往滨海湾金沙酒店，抵达后直接找寻到1号塔楼酒店的入口，搭乘电梯到位于最高层57楼的餐厅品尝下午茶。这里也是通过阅读网友的攻略推介所选择的游览项目。网友的攻略提到：&ldquo;金沙酒店57楼的这一边是SKY ON 57，另一边是意大利菜，中间就是无边泳池。中间不互通。这个下午茶套餐划算死了，有无敌景观，还有超级美味，&hellip;&hellip;。所以，如果你想享受无边泳池的美景，又不舍得MBS的高昂住宿费，可以来SKY ON 57下午茶。&rdquo;我们实践后感觉还真是物有所值，值得推介。两人份的下午茶费用为78新币再加17%的税费，虽然价格不菲，但包含鹅肝酱小笼包和卡布奇诺鲜菇汤，还有摆放非常精致且品种挺多的点心，再加上茶水鲜奶（也可以点咖啡）是无限量供应。更重要的是这里可以观赏新加坡滨海湾的艳丽风光。吃着点心，喝着茶水，看着风景，谈着感受，不知不觉时间就过去了。其间我们多次到室外阳台居高临下观赏新加坡的美景，脚下的鱼尾狮公园碧波荡漾，身后的滨海湾花园郁郁葱葱，远方的高楼大厦美不胜收，延伸的城市高架气势磅礴，还有遥远的海港码头和宽阔的海面，真是百看不厌流连忘返。最后用华夏借记卡刷卡付款91.8新币，折合约440元，非常奢侈的消费，但最终还是觉得确实很值得到此一游。,17/12/2016,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/sands-skypark-15131377-93233931?locale=en-SG,Skypark

M46***93,5.0,新加坡环球影城的万圣夜超级棒！整个园区氛围感满满，万圣节主题的游乐设施大致可有三种，一种是一些白天的项目晚上照常比如木乃伊室内过山车，虽然没有npc但依然很有气氛，第二种是街边划定一个区域跟着人流三两成行浏览，这种会有npc突然在转角处吓唬你，第三种是精心搭建的临时场地里面有布景和大良npc，需要排队很长时间游玩。我们排队的时候，前面正好是一群大汉，为我们打前阵，所以还好不是很恐怖。夜里的环球很不一样，比白天还要热，人还要多。强烈推荐，不枉此行。,30/11/2023,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-179942320?locale=en-SG,USS

lin***ro,5.0,作为亲子游必去项目，新加坡的环球虽然小，还是值得去嗨玩一下的。很早团了不限次数的快速通，虽然携程比KLOOK加贵了不少，但是，有了快速通还是可以畅玩自己喜欢的。因为出国行时间就是金钱，所以，还是选择花了高价买了无限次。孩子们超值，刷了二十次神龙飞车。玩人类战队机械战队不用排队的感觉真的爽。但是，没想到木乃伊复仇竟然没有多少人玩，从下午开始排队也就5分钟，我感觉我的无限次没什么用武之地。所以只刷了三次。其他项目也蛮好玩，就不赘述了。然后，再吐槽一下新加坡环球关门时间实在是太早了，可能由于天气太热的原因，演职和工作人员也都不容易。我很遗憾没有排到跟汽车人合影拍照📷。还有侏罗纪的漂流真的太爽了。最后那一下值得连刷三次。到后面连快速通都要排队半小时，可见大家都爱。记得一定要穿拖鞋或速干凉鞋，旅游鞋一定会湿透(*^^*)。我就不得不买了一双🩴，花了120大洋。还得全程背着湿鞋子😂。商店里的好时巧克力真的太太划算，像MM豆一样可以自己往下漏，漏了一袋子，人民币就一百多。环球的周边设计得比较一般，没有什么购买欲望。乐园里的水世界演出还是非常棒的！给演职人员👍！,04/09/2023,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-178830113?locale=en-SG,USS

I think universal studios sg is suitable for any ages to go there, heard that there is fireworks at night,  since I have to attend class at night, missed the fireworks, my family has been to there before as well, they spent the whole day there, that&rsquo;s wonderful, they placed the transformer game twice but it is very crowded during weekends, I would rather go there in weekdays, though it is still needed to queue up, it won&rsquo;t take too long and it is acceptable for me, if you don&rsquo;t mind to queue up for the games, it should be fine, we tried the cafe there, the food is not so good, it would be better that you have the lunch first before going there or if you are fine with some snacks, it is okay to eat there, due to the hot weather, we bought many drinks, better bring the water bottle and keep hydrated, else you should find the shelters or bring the umbrella. definitely, recommended others to go there, we go to play the Sesame Street game, dancing show (unluckily it is very short, we are told that it was cancelled afterwards, I bet that it might be the dancers feeling sick)&hellip; if you have not bought the express ticket, suggest to play the game without express queue, it will be faster &hellip;;)",25/01/2024,3,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-180509838?locale=en-SG,USS

悠莜琦琦,4.0,新加坡环球影城，真是很适合小朋友啊，尤其是男宝，我们家之前去过两次迪士尼，因为园区太大，怕他玩的累，我还买的两天票，结果他玩的这个也没意思，那个也没意思，去逛的时候这个是女生的那个是女生的￼￼￼￼让我觉得我白费了一天的钱，灯光秀也不肯看￼￼￼早早就要回酒店。,12/11/2023,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-179741161?locale=en-SG,USS
悠莜琦琦,4.0,新加坡环球影城包括了多个主题区，包括美国小镇、哈利波特的魔法世界、未来世界和探险世界等。其中，美国小镇是这里最受欢迎的主题区之一，可以在这里感受到美国西部的风情和氛围。此外，这里还有许多精彩的演出和表演，让您的旅程更加丰富多彩。,12/11/2023,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-179741128?locale=en-SG,USS

M39***28,4.0,新加坡环球影城虽然很小，但是最好还是提前规划。个人建议:1.买一个提前入园票，最大好处在于你比大部队排队地点提前了很远.11:00一开放，你先去刷大项目过山车，水世界之类。哪怕你不买速通票，12:00前基本就能刷完大多数项目。另外也可以提前进入拍拍照，个人觉得这个票很值。2.关于速通，个人看法是单次速通就足够了，下午才用的上速通，上午除了过山车，其他基本用不上。也不是所有项目都能速通。个人看法，虽然小贵，但是确实降低很大的排队痛苦指数，忍忍，买吧。3.16:00的未来水世界的表演很值得去看，可以说很撑评分。最前面板凳会湿哟，第二种颜色板凳最佳。,14/08/2023,4,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-178299366?locale=en-SG,USS

wpi***66,4.0,乐园很小，不少项目停运（大剧场，未来水世界），在建项目（MINION，2024年开），项目上服务人员少，造成效率低下，热门项目（过山车，侏罗纪公园等）排队时间120分钟（7月旅游旺季）。变形金刚项目下午4点去做大概15-20分钟就可以。建议从左到右玩，人少些排队时间短。在旺季建议最好提前买好无限快速票，不然天气太热，排队时间长吃不消，主要是排队，特别是外围，基本上设施中只有电扇，没有空调，太消耗体力。快速票人员也很多，在旺季没有快速票都不想排队。我们没做好功课，没有提前买快速票，看到排队长想当场买却买不到。,25/07/2023,0,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-177746945?locale=en-SG,USS

Fibemini,5.0,圣诞假期，人山人海，入园立刻决定去购买优先票。优先票是在门票以外另外购买，分为limited express和unlimited express两种，分别为60新币和80新币每人，大人小孩不分，价格一致。unlimted express每个项目只能使用优先通道一次，而unlimited express不限次数。unlimited express是手上戴腕带，到项目门口露出腕带就可以直接走入优先通道，看那种limited express是拿着纸制的票还要门口让工作人员检查。所以方便程度来说是unlimited express更方便，不过我们带着孩子根本没可能每个项目都玩，那些热门项目也只能玩了一次，实际上limited express就足够了。不过unlimited express比limited express也没贵很多，还算信价比不错。圣诞期间虽然人很多，但很有节日气氛，演出都是圣诞主题的，玩得很开心，孩子也很尽兴。,02/01/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-69074795?locale=en-SG,USS

_CF***16,5.0,作为一个世界级的游乐场，少不了的就是刺激，但与其它游乐场比起来，新加坡环球影城则是与众不同。新加坡环球影城拥有古埃及、失落的世界和好莱坞等七个主题区，都是根据各个著名电影建造的，每一个可都是经典中的经典。不过，在我看来，最值得去的就是木乃伊复仇记、太空堡垒和侏罗纪河流探险了。木乃伊复仇记：急转弯、快翻转，这个室内过山车，感受高速冲击带来的刺激。在黑暗的笼罩下，跟随过山车一起下沉，迅速躲过擦身而过的火球、爬行虫以及木乃伊大军。太空堡垒：世界最高双轨过山车，新加坡环球影城人气最高、最刺激的项目，过山车分为传统车厢式和吊臂式轨道，两条轨道在空中交错运行，只是看看都觉得很刺激。侏罗纪河流探险：坐上360度旋转的圆形船筏穿过侏罗纪原始森林，凶猛的霸王龙在你身边自由出没。周围水花四溅， 来之前重温下电影会更有画面感哦！,04/05/2019,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-158683855?locale=en-SG,USS

CD云上,5.0,第一次去这种国际性的主题乐园，颠覆了很多想象和游乐场的认知，原来以为就和欢乐谷差不多。我只想说超级好玩，一行大人和小孩玩的非常愉快。由于我们下午6点的飞机，买了快速票。50新币一个人，加上门票差不多500人民币一个人，价格算是非常贵了，不过里面项目真的很刺激和好玩，变形金刚，木乃伊，还有一个漂流都很好，唯一美中不足的是，所有项目只有英文解说，对于我这种水平的来说，表示只能听懂一部分，小孩就完全不能听懂了，如果配一个翻译的耳机就好了。还有就是园区消费很贵，矿泉水也很贵，我们都是带水杯在里面接水喝。,22/08/2017,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-119771686?locale=en-SG,USS

Rebecca-Rui,5.0,一定要早进园，早进园的好处是，早点玩上最刺激最好玩的变形金刚3D，过山车等。进园第一个主题就是好莱坞主题，这里和迪斯尼一样都是礼品店，一定不要刚开始在这里逛浪费时间，这里是离开时才要花时间的地方，进园一直走路口向右拐再走就到了纽约主题乐园，以芝麻街为主，科幻城市，也是全环球影城最精彩最精华的地方，所以强烈推荐，进园后哪都不去直奔这里，我们去的时候根本没人排队，第一人称视角，做EVAC车上置身于战场之中，玩了两遍。过山车分蓝色轨道和红色轨道，分别是坐式和悬挂式，尤其悬挂式超级过瘾，也是人很少，玩多少遍都行。古埃及主题的木乃伊复仇记：室内过山车急转弯、快翻转也很好玩，就是伸手不见五指。,26/12/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-94190150?locale=en-SG,USS
M22***41,5.0,9:30就到门口了。先拍照，你们懂得，就在环球标志那里，然后去入口排队。9:50穿靴子的猫出来和大家打招呼，太可爱了。10:00入园，直接去玩变形金刚，只等了5分钟，。然后去玩过山车，木乃伊...侏罗纪公园的漂流很好玩，就是全湿了。未来水世界的表演一定要看（主角又换了，这工作也是蛮辛苦的）。千万不要一直玩激烈的项目，里面吃的东西也很好，侏罗纪公园前面有个餐厅里面的米线很好吃。史瑞可那里有个冰激凌 芒果味的好吃。还有许多表演 我们看了芝麻街、穿靴子的猫、圣诞节的节目都很赞。人不多，排队也不长，好玩的太多，要安排一天噢。周边吃的也不错，有许多海鲜馆子。,13/12/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-93151587?locale=en-SG,USS
_We***58,5.0,到新加坡必去的景点，我一个人还是去玩了！很有趣！就奔着难度大的几个游戏去就行了，就挑凡是小孩不能玩，122以上才能玩，需要大人陪同才能玩的就行了。过山车有红线和灰线2种，灰线脚悬空，比较恐怖，2个都很快，我坐第一排也无压力。变形金刚就是4D也不错。个人觉得木乃伊那个过山车，因为在黑暗之中更恐怖。还有漂流其实不用买雨衣，就最后一下湿一点，一晒就干，把包包放保管箱就好。还有水上表演，感觉也不错，跟广州长隆的差不多，挺刺激的。,18/11/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-91747037?locale=en-SG,USS
陈之豪,5.0,【影城简介】作为东南亚地区唯一的一家环球影城（Universal Studio)，新加坡环球影城总是具有非常高的知名度，同样这也是也是好莱坞梦工厂在亚洲的设立的第二个游乐场。【交通信息】由于我们是自由行，我们选择了最最便捷的一条交通线路。新加坡的地铁的确是十分发达，因此交通是十分便捷的。乘坐地铁到达怡丰城(Vivo City)三楼，购买车票搭乘圣淘沙捷(expess)运进入圣淘沙名胜世界。圣淘沙的交通同样十分便捷，只要购买一张车票，就可以在圣淘沙世界随意换成捷运，无论是去往海滩附近，还是环球影城公园，都是非常方便的。乘坐捷运在第二站下车，随着人流继续往前走，就能够看到大大的环球影城标记了。【游玩心得】1.新加坡环球影城的票价在295元，同样也可以选择购买便捷票，排队人数会少一些，不用等很长时间。其实我个人的建议是要看去的时间，我们是8月底前往新加坡的，那天不是周末，因此人不是很多，特别是等到傍晚临近闭园的时候，几乎没有什么人，因此，我们虽然没有购买便捷票，但也基本玩到了所有的项目。当然，如果带着孩子，或者自己本身不差钱的话，购买便捷票还是很有必要的，可以大大省去一笔时间。2.进到园内，首先一定要拿一张中文版的导览图，里面会有所有景点以及游玩项目的介绍。之前在攻略上看到很多人推荐要逆时针游玩，根据此次的游览经验，逆时针游玩似乎也不会减少很多的排队时间。3.最最热门的一定是变形金刚项目了，我们游玩的第一个项目。等了整整2个小时，非常劳累。总体感觉效果一般，3D效果挺逼真的，但是等了2小时就看这个，实在感觉不值得。4.埃及馆的木乃伊很值得一去，一个小型的室内过山车，有心脏病的人千万不能去。配合音效总体感觉相当不错的。5.红蓝过山车是一定得推荐的，前提排队前一定要寄存包。坐过山车的感觉是很爽的，也是全球难得一见的双轨过山车，很值得体验。【总体感觉】新加坡环球环球影城不是很大，花上一天的时间，足够游玩。拿上导览图，玩一整圈，自己慢慢探索与发现，一定会让你感到乐趣无限的。此外，如果一个人出行的话，很多项目可以使用单人快速通道，可以省去排队的时间。,28/09/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-88160582?locale=en-SG,USS
幽羽天,5.0,很好玩，2岁左右孩子能玩的项目不多，建议顺时针玩，先玩孩子的，马达加斯加，旋转木马，侏罗纪小飞龙，芝麻街，变形金刚旋转杯差不多小孩子可以玩。有些有身高限制。买了快速票，觉得还蛮值，全程基本无排队，变形金刚和美国的一样，侏罗纪没美国好玩，木乃伊很刺激，不过侏罗纪晚上7点关门，快速票有四个项目无法使用，建议可以7点前去排，人比较少,03/09/2016,9,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-87065406?locale=en-SG,USS
Ssssulivan,5.0,第三天我们的主要活动区域都集中在圣淘沙了，这个地方也确实能够玩一天。我的安排是上午环球影城、下午海洋公园和亚洲最大糖果店Candilicious.环球影城门票原价68坡币一位承认。它逆时针（7个主题区域按照环形排列）游览古埃及、失落的世界、遥远王国、马达加斯加以及位于园区门口的好莱坞和纽约。友告诉我一个小TIPS，排队有两个通道，一个是常规通道也就是可以选座位的，还有一个是个人通道，也就是里面有座位就塞你进去坐，但是不能挑座位，不过这个有个好处就是基本不用排队，我打算下次试试。环球影城里，每隔一段时间就会有电影角色跑出来跟你合影，动作一定要快！因为他们是有时间限制的。我如愿以偿地和小黄人合影了！还有功夫熊猫~~~在每一个主题公园门口都可以和电影人物合影，那里会有专门的摄影师帮你拍照，当场打印，但是那个是要收费的。不过他们很好人，拿自己的相机拍完之后也会用你的相机帮你拍，你可以省下一笔钱。他们一点也不嫌弃你这样做，是主动帮你的，这点非常赞~~~,12/08/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-84415349?locale=en-SG,USS

绕指烟香,5.0,去新加坡非常值得去的一个景点。比较热门的项目基本和过山车有关。如木乃伊归来、双轨过山车、变形金刚等等。当然其他小型的过山车也是排队超长的。激流勇进也不错，最好带上雨衣，我玩了2次都湿透了，也许是运气不好吧。个人认为史瑞克4D不错，值得一看。还有说说优先票，个人觉得没必要购买，如果住的不远、不是周末去的话，就上午10点多去，进园后先往左边玩，中午可以出园吃饭并回酒店休息一下后到3点多进园往右边玩，这时候变形金刚、木乃伊、激流勇进等等热门的基本没人排队了，想玩几次都可以。,22/07/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-84018899?locale=en-SG,USS
赵小南😈,5.0,好吧，把我的经验介绍给大家。去年第一次来环球影城赶上人不是太多，而且带着3岁的孩子，大多数游艺孩子都玩不来，所以我们也没怎么玩，这种情况下就没必要买优先证了。这次来第一个看到变形金刚就已经排队都排到外头了，果断决定买优先证！环球影城的优先证概念不像是迪士尼乐园，其实就是有钱任性！他的优先证包含园内所有的游艺项目，就是说你只要花钱买了它，你就可以玩什么都不排队啦！是不是很很任性？！所以年轻人来，冲着要把所有游艺项目都玩遍的买这个合适，带孩子来的，人口又少，没人帮着看孩子的，就不要买了，买了也是糟践钱啊。优先证分两种，我买的是每一个游艺项目都可以享受一次优先权的卡片式，30新币。卡的背面是所有游艺项目的名字，玩过一个就划掉一个，有些游艺很小儿科的，而且还有一些是表演类的，本人木有兴趣啊，所以这张卡我们也没有都玩全。还有一种优先证是手环的，是所有项目无限次享用优先权的，50新币。环球影城要说最好玩的还是变形金刚那个，然后就是蓝色的过山车，再然后就是木乃伊那个，反正你记住了，整个影城里就那么几个进去之前必须要存包的，那准是最好玩的了。变形金刚很新颖，4D效果特别的好，感觉就是身临其境。过山车有两个红色和蓝色，蓝色带翻滚，红色没有。我们本想都玩的，可是在先坐完蓝色的以后就完全不能够了，下来后就一个感觉，晕！于是乎，红色放弃了还有啊，可不要以为来公园了就会很热，这里的游艺项目只要是一进室内，都是冷气逼人，一样的冰火两重天特别给带小孩子来的一个建议，给孩子多带一件空调衫，热了可以脱，冷时起码有的穿,09/07/2016,6,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-83822201?locale=en-SG,USS
_CF***90,5.0,我们是7月3日去的环球影城，不到9点半就到达了sentosa，那时门口已经是排的人山人海，可是在入门时我们几个人分别拍了几个队，最后找到一个最短的队伍，以最快的速度入园！(门票为网上提前订购270RMB)入园后我们商量了一下决定买一张50新币的快速票，就是每个项目可以不用排很久的队，可以优先的票，个人认为如果是成年人，又不需要必须的与他人同乘游乐设施的情况下这钱可以省掉，因为有一种就单人乘的通道，可以直接进去和别人分享游乐设施，基本跟优先票功能一样，又快又省钱！所有的游艺项目玩过来基本是4个小时就够，比国内的欢乐谷小很多，不过绿化环境好，游艺项目比较新奇，还是值得一玩，没有什么让人特别的东西！木乃伊那个室内的过山车还是挺刺激的，个人最喜欢看未来水世界的精彩真人秀！英语听力在这里显得尤为重要，听惯标准英语的人，到这里基本没有什么用武之地！园中随处有免费的饮用水，可以不带或自备水壶就行，吃饭买零食如果不乘以汇率可以说相当便宜，人家当地人花个10块钱吃顿饭跟在园外价格没啥区别！要是我们国内这游乐场内外的价格就能翻番！最后从环球影城出来后，在后面走了十几分钟就来到了亚洲最难端的海滩，夕阳西下，真的有不想回去的心！,04/07/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-83581089?locale=en-SG,USS
_We***41,5.0,100[%]推荐，所以直接入正题，讲攻略:-提前三天在携程网买票，可以优惠-提前半小时到园区，可节省机动游戏的排队时间。建议坐在VivoCity站轉乘RWS8巴士，2新加坡元，比坐Express(4元)便宜，需时只是20分钟，Casino站下车-入园后先去熱門景点：变型金刚，埃及世界，迷失世界(会湿身的哦)...如果发现人太多，建议留至6pm再去。總之，人最少的时间是开园及傍晚，亲-园内额外收费项目有：餐饮，雨衣，储物柜。储物柜头45分钟免费，之后计费。我们那次入园不得不给了4元储物费...,03/07/2016,5,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-83337086?locale=en-SG,USS
M32***25,5.0,我只能说环球影城太棒，过山车相当刺激，有一个4d的变形金刚特别棒，坐着车进去，你感觉变形金刚拿着枪对着你的那一刻自己真的要被枪毙了，就是排队太长了，不过可以买插队票，即使排队也是相当值的，旋转木马是热带风情的，储物柜都是智能计时的，根据排队的时间计算是否需要花钱储物，木乃伊的室内过山车是世界绝无仅有的，黑乎乎的超级刺激，就是里边吃的比较贵，一个火鸡腿要18新币，环球影城比迪士尼好太多，不去简直太遗憾，强烈推荐,17/04/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-72029503?locale=en-SG,USS
开心_麻咪,5.0,环球影城非常赞，虽然我们是周六去的，人较多，但是我们进大门以后顺时针玩，先从儿童喜欢的项目开始，到下午去变形金刚的时候基本没有排队，各种项目基本都玩了，适合小孩子玩的项目还是挺多的，大人孩子都很开心。,23/03/2016,10,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-71650508?locale=en-SG,USS
JuliaPig,5.0,环球影城非常值得一去！和其他国际化主题乐园一样，影城的门票也是贼贵啊，我们还买了两张价值人民币230元/张的［优先证］，包括门票在内，就已经花了1200人民币了！影城一共有7大主题区域，每个主题都有2到4个主题游戏和1到3个表演互动，当然入园一定要拿张表演时刻表，安排好自己的行程和时间。如果没有［优先证］，就很难准确预计自己的时间了。每个游戏外面都会有预计等待时间，好多热门游戏都是40分钟或以上的等待，但是我们用了优先证，最多只需等10分钟就会轮到我们。这里要提醒一点，影城4岁以下的儿童免票，所以也免优先证，4岁以上是儿童票。前面提到，有两个项目是没有优先通道的：一个是&ldquo;失落的世界&rdquo;区里的&ldquo;天幕飞行&rdquo;，还有一个是&ldquo;古埃及&rdquo;区里的&ldquo;寻宝奇兵&rdquo;，可惜我们去到这两个游戏的时候，都是要等待40分钟或60分钟。古埃及区最简单，只有两个游戏项目，上面提到的&ldquo;寻宝奇兵&rdquo;我们没玩，另一个&ldquo;木乃伊复仇记&rdquo;只有我一个人玩了，完全就是在黑暗中玩过山车原本想玩完这个之后我一个人去坐另外两个限身高的&ldquo;太空堡垒&rdquo;过山车，可是我也年纪一大把了，确实有点儿脚发软，还是快快带孩子去玩轻松一点的游戏吧热门的游戏项目，不用我说大家也猜到了，就是&ldquo;科幻城市&rdquo;区的&ldquo;变形金刚3D对决&rdquo;，没想到的是，这个游戏就是一个超XD的电影游戏！影城里还有一些首创的项目，比如前面提到过的我们没有玩的&ldquo;太空堡垒&rdquo;双轨过山车，就是红蓝两条轨道，同时发出两列过山车分别以超高速行驶开去；还有&ldquo;遥远王国&rdquo;区的&ldquo;鞋猫剑客历险记&rdquo;，是全球首个悬吊飞车，坐在里面新奇好玩，而且还挺安全的，其他的游戏都是主题化的常见游戏了，比如：&ldquo;马达加斯加&rdquo;区里面的&ldquo;朱利安国王的旋转舞会&rdquo;就是旋转木马的形式；&ldquo;木箱漂流记&rdquo;就是坐着小船延水流看马达加斯加里人物的故事，还有&ldquo;遥远王国&rdquo;区里面的&ldquo;小龙飞行学校&rdquo;就是小型过山车，比较适合孩子玩，&ldquo;失落的世界&rdquo;区的&ldquo;恐龙骑士&rdquo;就和我们平时玩的转圈圈的小飞象一样，&ldquo;纽约&rdquo;区里面的&ldquo;芝麻街之意大利面太空战&rdquo;有点儿像香港迪斯尼的&ldquo;巴斯光年&rdquo;游戏，都是以外太空为游戏背景，&ldquo;失落的世界&rdquo;区里面有一个&ldquo;侏罗纪河流探险&rdquo;就是综合版的激流勇进，河岸两边都是丛林和恐龙，水流急的时候，船就摇摆厉害，时不时还有恐龙喷水到船上，最后一个超级大落差溅起的水花，肯定会把人弄湿，所以这个游戏最好准备雨衣，悲催的是我们木有准备......,10/03/2016,8,https://sg.trip.com/review/universal-studios-singapore-89732-71479868?locale=en-SG,USS
