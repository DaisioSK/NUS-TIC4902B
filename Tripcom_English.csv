Aleksandrsaf,5.0,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a place where the vibrancy of nature bursts through the seams of the city&#39;s fabric.

Swan Lake is another spot of calm - though sometimes the swans can be a little shy, dodging the enthusiastic visitor.

Royalreigns,4.0,"Botanical gardens offer a refreshing and educational escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. They serve as oases of natural beauty and environmental preservation. These gardens typically feature a wide variety of plants, trees, and flowers from around the world.What makes botanical gardens special is their role in both conservation and education. They often serve as living museums, showcasing diverse plant species and providing a unique opportunity for visitors to learn about the natural world. Many botanical gardens conduct research and conservation efforts to protect endangered plant species and promote ecological awareness.A visit to a botanical garden can be a tranquil and inspiring experience, as you can explore meticulously landscaped grounds, learn about different plant species, and appreciate the artistry of garden design. Many botanical gardens also offer educational programs, workshops, and events for all ages, making them an excellent resource for those interested in horticulture, ecology, and conservation.Whether you&#39;re a nature enthusiast, a student, or simply looking for a peaceful and beautiful setting to unwind, a botanical garden is an ideal destination.

Namangaur,5.0,"Just love our Unesco listed Botanical Gardens so accessible now with the MRT circle line ending at the Bukit Timah Entrance. We arranged to meet at 10am but because the rain got heavier took refuge at the Bees&#39;Knees for coffee until it became a mere drizzle. The cafe was crowded and short-staffed so some customers got impatient but it served a very good croissant and Cappuccino for $7 and $5.50 or $6 respectively. Then we went to our favourite stretches of the Symphony Lake with its statues of Chopin etc, enjoyed the huge lily pads, the one beautiful white swan, the Herconium Garden, bamboo groves, trellis pathway, unusual trees like the Brazilian cannonball and aged banyan. The write-ups were most informative and it was a delight to sight birds like plover, sunbird as well as catch glimpses of salamanders crawling along pathways and staircases. Meanwhile a profusion of bougainvillea, frangipani and other blooms delight your senses while kampong fowl make their way on the grasses,crowing occasionally. We had lunch at The Halia which is now halal with local dishes and international selections like pizza and salad but do make a reservation as space is limited with social distancing requirements now. The food is good though a trifle expensive and they sell bottled jam and sauces. The Orchid enclosure is open to seniors at $1 per pax and there is a small waterfall, spice garden and numerous benches for lounging as well as clean toilets and a water fountain at Cafe Verde.",01/09/23,2,https://sg.trip.com/review/singapore-botanic-gardens-76133-178746061?locale=en-SG,Botanic Garden,True

These layers are particularly obvious in younger palms, giving them a stout, shaggy appearance, but they gradually thin out as the palm matures to reveal a slender stem hidden beneath.

First, the Supertree Grove is like sci-fi movie set, especially at night when they light up. Shiok!Next, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest - wah, like aircon in there. Perfect if the temperature is a bit hot outside. You can see all sorts of plants from different countries. Plus, got seasonal displays, so got something new every visit.The outdoor gardens also steady one. Can walk walk, enjoy the fresh air, and take Instagram-worthy pics at every corner. Don&#39;t forget the OCBC Skyway, where you can see Marina Bay Sands and the whole city skyline.Food also got plenty options around, from food court selling affordable fares including thai food, nasi lemak and pastas to fast food like shake shack and McDonalds. There is even Starbucks there. So, you won&#39;t go hungry, promise.But remember, if you go in the afternoon, take the shuttle service (at Bayfront mrt gardens by the bay exit) to flower dome and cloud garden! Alternatively or also, you may visit the air-conditioned floral fantasy and take its 3d adventure ride.

Bbom comando,5.0,"just got back 2 weeks from singapore, here are my brief comments:1. MRT is the best, even we went with 2 toddlers. Tried taxi twice only from changi to hotel flat rate $60 (single trip)2. Singapore is kid and stroller friendly! lift accessible almost everywhere3. Hot and humid. You need plenty water to drink. sometimes got exhausted, better not to squeeze your itinerary to much in a single day. also, i bought a neck fan. helped me cool off during hot day.4. MRT ezlink pass, when about to return back to your country, if you still have balance. you can spend to buy at the 7eleven or cash refunded at some selected mrt stations. 5. When ordering food, especially at hawker centre, dont expect them to say &ldquo;hi sir/mam, how are you, thank you, or even smile&rdquo; speed is more important than hospitality, considering when its busy lunch time6. what a Clean city! make sure you dont litter as well7. You get lost, do not hesitate to ask. People are friendly enough to help you (my experience)8. Escalator in singapore is kinda quick. be careful (my mom almost fell once lol 😅) 9. Garden of the bay and marina bay both are full day experience. dont forget watch garden rhapsody light show and within walking distance, you need to watch &lsquo;spectra&rsquo; (light water show) at marina bay after. check the schedule time. YOu Must watch both! they re so amazing!10. Amazing city. i love it. food is the best..will 100000% returnone last thing! who said to get to singapore zoo is difficult!? sssssooo easy! just mrt to Khatib and they have suttle bus (1$ by ez link pass). from khatib to singapore zoo directly. bus is also stroller friendly. Enjoy! i love river wonder!oh yeah. one super last thing.

Ryenicjen,5.0,"The Singapore Flyer is an iconic landmark that offers a unique perspective of the Lion City&rsquo;s breathtaking skyline. After a recent visit, I can confidently say that this attraction lives up to its reputation as one of Singapore&rsquo;s must-see destinations.	1.	Spectacular Views: The most obvious highlight of the Singapore Flyer is, of course, the panoramic views it provides. As the world&rsquo;s largest observation wheel, it offers a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the city that&rsquo;s simply awe-inspiring. From Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the Bay, and even glimpses of neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia on clear days, the vistas are nothing short of spectacular.	2.	Comfortable Capsules: The spacious and air-conditioned capsules are a comfortable way to take in the scenery. Each capsule has plenty of room to move around and offers both sitting and standing options, making it suitable for visitors of all ages.	3.	Informative Audio Guide: The audio guide provides fascinating insights into the city&rsquo;s history, landmarks, and architecture as you rotate above. It adds depth to the experience, turning a scenic ride into an educational one.	4.	Day and Night Experiences: Whether you visit during the day to see the city in all its vibrant glory or choose a night ride to witness the city&rsquo;s dazzling lights, the Singapore Flyer offers different experiences, each with its unique charm.	5.	Photography Opportunities: Photographers and Instagram enthusiasts will be in heaven. The Flyer provides ample opportunities to capture breathtaking shots, making it a must-visit for shutterbugs.In summary, the Singapore Flyer is a quintessential Singaporean experience that should not be missed. Whether you&rsquo;re a tourist exploring the city or a local looking to see your home in a new light, this giant observation wheel offers a memorable journey through the heart of Singapore&rsquo;s skyline.

Dynamik HRZN,4.0,"To get to the zoo was pretty convenient- Took the MRT and then a 10-minute bus ride there. Just before the ticket entrance, there is a food court catering for various palates. We had KFC. The zoo was clean and had friendly, helpful staff. The wide-range of animals seemed well-kept and the animal enclosures were &lsquo;natural&rsquo; looking - the only negative part was that some enclosures emitted a really bad smell. We missed the shows and feeding times so cannot comment on that.
