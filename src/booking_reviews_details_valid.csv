It had a freezer / fridge, pans, utensils, plates, bread toaster, water purifier, and washer/dryer. I like water purifier the most as I don't need to order water from the guest services, I just have to fill in the purifier to have a potable water.  I also like the washer/dryer, we didn't pack a lot of clothes and utilized the washer/dryer -- takes around 4 hrs per load, but you can leave it open while you're away.It is very near MRT station from Red/Green line and Blue line. Very accessible since it is in the heart of the city.Very near Lau Pa Sat for food.",The room smells old.The living room TV wifi is flaky.The TV in the bedroom had no wifi and the off switch from the remote doesn't work.

Breakfast was very mediocre and not value for money despite it was not included in room rent and I paid extra for breakfast at the restaurant3. Hotel room and washrooms seems need renovation as furniture, door handles,washroom sanitary items etc. have gone old4. Elevator tunnel was very close to my room and its operational noise kept on waking me up whole night5. No water bottles in room for coffee making.

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Sheryl,United States,Cutler Suite,2.0,2023-11-01,Couple,"Great location, wonderful staff, nice hotel",9.0,"The Ascott Raffles Singapore is a wonderful hotel. The staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and modern, and the kitchen facilities came in handy. We had a nice view from a high floor. (See photos.) The location was in the business district, so there weren't a lot of restaurants around there and things were pretty quiet over the weekend, but it was in a great location. We were two blocks from the market with the hawker food stalls, and the metro was right across the street.  Because we were centrally located, we were able to walk to the Gardens on the Bay, The Marina Sands, the river/bay areas,  and Chinatown.  Our flight out of Singapore was very late and we had to check out of our room around noon, but there was a nice room available for lounging, watching TV, snacking, etc. that was available to us after we checked out.  The receptionist also said we could have access to the pool and shower facilities if we needed it after check out.","There were some issues with maintenance in our room. There had been some sort of leak from the bathroom and some of the floorboards just outside the bath were buckled, making it a bit dangerous for bare feet. Also, the door trim at the bath door was rotted, probably from the leak. It may have been an isolated incident in this particular room, but these sorts of things were unsightly, unsafe, and should have been repaired, particularly in a hotel of this caliber.  The AC worked well, but there wasn't a way to turn off the fan without turning off the air conditioner completely. It would have been nice to have the automatic style AC that shuts the fan off when the room gets to the proper temperature. The bed was a bit too firm for my tastes, but otherwise the room was comfortable.",10/11/2023,10/02/2024

The walls are well isolated though.You can hear people when they are in the hallway.And in the hallway, you can hear people showering or speaking.This is a major flaw that can ruin your rest if your neighbours are loud.Also, sometimes you will have to wait a bit to get a table for breakfast.

Everyone and everything from my very first step to my last second in the hotel was nothing but deep care, kindness, and professionalism.The cleaning staff cleans your room when you're away, even twice sometimes just to tidy up the room - which never or rarely happened in the other hotels I stayed in.The hotel doesn't feel crowded and the room is very silent which is very enjoyable for people who enjoy peace and privacy in hotels. The location is very good, literally 2 minutes by foot to Orchard's main road, same for the subway.The water pressure is very good, which isn't the case for many hotels it seems like. The view was great with plenty of light. The light/curtain controls are awesome and easy to understand, unlike many hotels where it seems like you need to understand how to pilot a spaceship to make one light work.Overall, it was the best hotel I stayed in and I will look forward to going back as soon as I can.",The hotel's wifi was public and I would have preferred having private wifi access specifically for customers.

The standard rooms are now much bigger, and the upgraded touches have been carried out with sensitivity and care.  It was so much fun to have electronically controlled curtains that scroll back to reveal the skyline when you enter the room.  Service here was exceptional. All staff we encountered were just really professional and courteous. We tried - the room service, the Chinese restaurant, the spa, breakfast, tea, pool facilities, as well as the ground floor bar, so we had a good chance to review and assess. Something different here we noticed at the Four Seasons - they have a Director of Quality Assurance, who is there to troubleshoot, and ensure the overall experience is exactly what each guest needs. This is a hotel I am most likely to return to next time I am in Singapore.","No major quibbles.

The room is a good size and the bathroom was clean and well equipped.   We only stayed one night but we were pretty happy.,After a long day of walking around and shopping we decided to have a drink on the bar at the hotel.  This was unfortunately closed for a private function.  Can’t help bad timing I guess.  What we did notice was that the front desk staff didn’t seem very engaging. On check out we couldn’t find any and a concierge staff member helped us find someone (even though the hotel had sent a message asking what time we were checking out).  The staff that turned up were just like the checkin staff …. Efficient but not the least bit friendly.  We are used to that in Australia but not in Singapore.,20/08/2023,08/02/2024

From the staff to the furniture, everything is pleasing to look at, well presented and operates well.  The gym is not gonna be like your home gym but you can get a good workout in it.  I didn't try the swimming pool, but it looked cool. The breakfast is lovely and varied each day. As I'm a fussy eater I had pretty much the same thing each day but you can try and vary your cuisine. The dining/foyer area is very welcoming with comfortable seats and soothing colours. I would definitely stay here again.  Well recommended!","There wasn't really anything that stands out that I didn't like to be honest.

Staff were very professional and customer service was top notch. Were lucky enough to get two room close to each other due to busy time. Garden view rooms were SPECTACULAR!! My mum who just rested in the room during our stay was able to admire the gardens by the bay and night view from the room. Big space in the room, balcony has a good set up to relax outside. Bathroom was very big and spacious.Infinity pool and spas at the top were the highlight. Like floating in the sky in such a beautiful city. One night was perfect amount of time to enjoy the hotel.","Our bathroom was not cleaned properly on arrival. There was still hair on the tiles and blood on the toilet seat from previous guests which was disappointing considering the amount we paid. Called room service to inform them. After leaving the room so they could clean it, went to the observatory deck, we came back an hour later after it had been cleaned only to realise they did not clean what was needed, still hair on the ground and blood on the toilet...not sure how that could be missed!! Called room service again and this time stayed in the room while they cleaned and showed them what we indicated over the phone had not been done. They were very good about it and we didn't make a big fuss or complain. Cleaned it all in the end well the 2nd round but I do have to wonder if their cleaning process is quite surface level...my sister and I were confused how you can miss blood around and on the toilet...That was the only disappointing part of the experience but still, infinity pool outshines it and would stay again!

Conveniently located above farrer park station.,"The elevators - they are slow, ultra quiet so you don't know when the elevator arrives at your floor and can miss it, also it's very difficult to see what floors are selected in the elevator because the buttons don't show much distinction, also each floor is not marked so if the lift is full and you can't see the digital screen there's no way to tell what floor you're on.

This is my second visit back to the hotel by the way and my family and I love the bathtub so much. We checked with Mina whether that particular room that I first visited was available but without second thought, the manager on Duty as well as Mina gave me a free room upgrade. It was really unexpected! It was really nice of them. I will definitely go back again with my family members. ☺️ KEEP UP THE GREAT SERVICE AND WORK!!","There's frankly nothing that I dislike except for the price of the hotel.

A very loud extended family or group was staying in rooms all around us and they would come back to the apartment around midnight slamming doors and yelling out to each other, running up and down the corridors and it was loud! The walls were very thin as we could hear the people talking in the room next door.  We also thought it was odd that the hospital overlooked the pool, but it didn’t impact our stay. We would probably stay closer to the city in the tourist area if we visit again, but if we could pick this hotel up and move it closer to the city/gardens area, we would.

It is devidee up into two room, a smaller and an even smaller one. You kind of always sit in the way of other people looking for food, the eggs need a long time to be prepared and it could be cleaner (the signs/ description cards of the food, the tables after someone else used them,...). I would also highly recommend to NOT share the cutlery to take certain foods from the buffet due to allergies. I, e.g., couldn't take melon/ mango etc. because the same fork was used to put pineapple on the plate.

Also, they clean every day which is great for us, but I think, for environmental reasons, should not be the case. They say put up the card/or press a button when you need cleaning and we never pressed it, but they still came to clean. Neither of these are deal breakers but just points for improvement.

Malek and Sarawaren - thanks for the entertaining chats and great services provided, which make our daily meals so much more enjoyable.

The suitcase area was in the bathroom which wasn’t ideal because of the steam when you had a shower.  The buffet for breakfast and lunch was expensive.  The service in that restaurant was not great.  At one point we reached our assigned table and there was still a small jug of milk sitting there.  We ordered tea, advised that jug of milk wasn’t mine and could I please have a fresh one.  When we walked away to get our food from the buffet, the lady looked around then sneakily put the old jug of milk back on the table and walked off.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Robin,Germany,Deluxe Panoramic Room,3.0,2024-01-01,Solo traveller,"Amazing Views, more human interaction and less digitalisation!",7.0,"First impression and last impressions are surely those who will leave a long lasting impression. Check-in service was great and was severed by a very friendly & motivated staff. The location of the Hotel is great when you have to go to Suntec city or even MBS, everything is in walking distance and the MRT is also close by. The view from the rooms are just stunning.","Unfortunately, the AC-only ventilation in the rooms wasn't my cup of tea, and there was a noticeable lingering smell. Maintenance seemed a bit overlooked; the shower water flow issue turned the whole floor into a wet zone.The primary concern lies in the check out process, a crucial and lasting impression on guests. Unfortunately they were disorganised and inefficient. Hotels are well-aware of peak hours and check out times, which just leads to the conclusion that the management has not effectively streamlined its operations. Using Covid as an excuse for the failed management just outlines the failure of the management to train its employees correctly. Express check-outs, self check in services are not preferred nor wanted by guests, which the hotel can clearly see from their daily operations. Employees should appreciate that guests prefer the human interaction, as the implementation of AI and digitalisation will diminish their requirements to perform this job. Indicating for job security you should not only be more organised but more motivated to provide a service. Failing to do so, jeopardises your job and this will come faster than an employee might think. Hence more personal interactions, improved and organised service are not only required, but surely wanted from the majority of the guests.",29/01/2024,10/02/2024

Pan Pacific Singapore,Gilbert,Hong Kong,Connecting Deluxe Panoramic Room,3.0,2023-08-01,Family,Stunning building inside architecturally speaking; but mostly a 3 star experience outside of the pool.,7.0,#NAME?,"- exceptionally slow staff at check-in - made zero amends for inconveniences of their own creation (3:00pm check-in turned into 5:00pm; a nightmare if travelling with cranky kids); what was more appalling was an unwillingness to even apologise for the inconvenience nor offer anything even if just a gesture to say sorry. No one was asking for a discount or a free night, but how about a complementary bottle of cheap wine even?- rooms are in need of a makeover; very dated rooms, odd design choices in one (Rm 2709 - vertical split doors to the bathroom that don’t lock)- rooms were noticeably dusty (we had four rooms in total)- slow service all around (ex. Room service cart that we wheeled back out of the room after dinner was still sitting there in the morning; and then after a long day at the zoo we returned in the evening to the same cart sitting by our door)- gym room needs an upgrade (dumbbells are literally falling apart and crumbling; need more dumbbells as well)-",13/08/2023,10/02/2024

Really thoughtful little gifts for the kids as well - the mini room slippers were one-of-a-kind and the joy it brought was priceless - not smth you'd usually think of getting as a parent but my toddler absolutely loved it.Room generously big by Singapore standards (for 4 of us) and the sofa bed even served as a toddler's bed at a perfect height and size with large armrests to prevent falling off. The hotel itself is timeless and insanely luxurious. From the moment you step in it doesn't even feel like Singapore, let alone a space near Orchard Rd. Breathtaking (for us, literally) size to walk through although you'd be amazed at the landscaping effort put in. Kids loved walking past the many(!) waterfalls and it felt more like an overseas holiday than a staycation. Which we badly needed with the kids :D",Just the carpark - highly advised to drop *all* luggage and kids off before parking because there are steps and space is tight between parked cars.,23/05/2023,10/02/2024

It is perfectly located on the river and is central to the city. The breakfasts were incredible, service excellent and the pool area busy but beautiful.","We were upgraded to a larger room, one that was river facing but we were on the level with the cement balastrade so we had a pretty unattractive view of a cement courtyard  ( like a prison exercise area , high cement wall blocking the view and light with no outlook or ambiance. ) You certainly would not sit out there. We were happy with the larger room and kept the curtains closed, it was too hot to sit outside anyway. We had dinner on the terrace outside in the restaurant on the night we arrived. Very slow service, average and overpriced food and drinks. I think the waitress' outfits make them look like street cleaners, nothing crisp or chic about their uniforms. The staff looked tired and overworked and their english very basic so they could not understand when we complained that my dinner arrived 20 mins before my husbands.

We went out to the jacuzzi in the main pool, even though it was raining, but were told by the staff that it was undergoing ‘maintenance’ ie. broken. As the jacuzzi was one of our main reasons for choosing this hotel, this was really disappojnting.Breakfast was expensive, so we didn’t include it, but there is an excellent cafe in the marina.",04/01/2024,10/02/2024

From check in to check out all the staff we encountered were so lovely and helpful and patient (important as we were travelling with energetic children). The kids loved getting a balloon and lollypop at check in, then the bracelet for free ice cream in the afternoons was a hit. After check in they also brought us up slippers and children dental kits which the kids loved. When the kids found out the pool was 24 hrs they were so excited. We had a late night swim (around 9pm) and it was beautiful, the lights from the hotel and gardens made for a beautiful setting. The rooms were beautiful (we had a fabulous twin and fabulous king) and so roomy. Bathrooms were huge! Buffet breakfast was one of the best we have ever been to. Everything was so fresh, coffee's made to order, select meals that could be ordered fresh as part of the buffet, even a pour your own bloody mary section. The breakfast was a hit with the kids and adults. We loved the pool during the day, plenty of sun lounges and shady seats. Swim up bar, water slide, hammocks, honestly we were blown away. Check out was smooth. We were even able to have complimentary late checkout on one of our rooms so we could enjoy the pool longer. Restaurants and bar on site and also plenty within walking distance. I wish we had stayed longer than 1 night and we can't wait to come back","The only thing we could fault is that the location is a bit secluded so if you're planning to do all the touristy things at Sentosa (beaches, resorts world etc) it's not part of the beach shuttle and monorail area. We had done all that already so we were able to just relax and enjoy all the W had to offer. We would pick this as our last spot to stay next time we come back to Singapore and book 3 or 4 days to just relax and enjoy ourselves",25/10/2023,10/02/2024

We had a couple of issues during our stay eg… had an issue with the washing machine, was sorted within an hour of contacting reception. Room cleaned to a high standard. Location suited our needs, it’s not close to the city, but getting a taxi is very easy. Can’t say what other transport is like, eg… bus, MRT, because we either walked or went by taxi. Supermarket open very early till 11pm, so convenient for the groceries we needed. The pool area is lovely, only had the opportunity to use it once. It’s kept clean and well maintained. Our room - the only thing that was missing was balcony furniture. The room was advertised as having a table and chairs, but none were there. If we’d spent more time at the hotel we would have asked about this. The room was a good size for two people. The bathroom was very open to view from the bedroom, with only glass partitions separating the two - no door. There were a couple of blinds to pull down adding limited privacy. There was however a separate toilet off the kitchen for the bashful.Kitchen was equipped for two people. No oven - but a microwave, toaster and two ring hob.

I had to follow this up with the hotel and the transaction didn't get cancelled for a whole week. If you plan to pay via booking.com, make sure you have ample extra money on your card as you might get charged twice. In saying that the hotel did a good job at promptly replying to my issue. Another minor point, I'm just being picky at this point, was the smell of the rooms. They've obviously been newly renovated so the smell of fresh plaster and paint is still prevalent. Also, the hotel does well and truly inform you but there was still renovations going on. Don't plan a red eye flight if you can avoid it as it (what I can only assume was jack-hammering) didn't stop until about 3pm.

We were not offered service recovery until we explicitly asked for it.  Even then, all that was offered was the taxi fare to the airport, which would have cost the hotel about $25. There was no real attempt to make an apology. Given the extent of the problems with the two rooms and the price we paid, I would say this is substandard.

Booking.com had an all inclusive price but hotel insisted taxes were not included.  This is unacceptable.  Prices should match.,24/01/2024,11/02/2024

Marina sands is about 20-25 minutes walk and both the botanical gardens and gardens by the bay are about a 10 minute grab ride away which costs 6-11spd. There are a lot of options for both international fast food and local food nearby with the famous Raffles one hawker centre about 10 minutes walk down upper cross street. I went for new year which is rainy season so there were a few days where I was met with heavy rain that lasted for about 30-40 minutes, but each room is provided with a heavy duty umbrella which is really useful. The room itself is lovely if you like clean minimalistic functional but comfortable decor with a good view. It has tea/ coffee making facilities, an iron, torch, towels as expected, dressing gown, slippers and your usual soaps, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. The breakfast is buffet style and has a lovely view of the outside greenery shielding you from the traffic and the architecturally wondrous atrium.","I started off with the garden room which as stated had a view of the garden- unfortunately with this came a few insects into my room, the smell of damp and early morning gardeners tending to the garden outside my window. Fortunately after speaking with the brilliant Duty manager Samuel Tan, this was soon rectified, and my parents and I were both upgraded to rooms with a 180 degree view of the cityscape as well as access to the lounge. He also apologised personally leaving us chocolate coated strawberries and macaroons. excellent customer service!",10/01/2024,11/02/2024

The hotel is very centrally located and the greenery brought a very calming environment.,"We had a few small issues and felt communication could have been better.  The lock on one of our rooms would not open and needed to be repaired.  After reporting it to the reception staff and them checking it themselves we waited over an hour with no update - our children were waiting to go for a swim but could not as their items were all in the room.  After going back to reception to check on the update (and after some confusion among the staff) we were told the repair would take another hour.  When the door was finally fixed an hour later we went back to the room only to find all the debris from the work sitting on the floor.  So we had to call reception and wait again for 1/2 hour for this to be remedied.  We were offered a late check out as an apology which was very much appreciated, but on the final day our keycards stopped working and so we had to go back to reception to get this remedied.",07/10/2023,11/02/2024

I would recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone.","The building is a thin, 30 story structure with only four lifts located around a central core. Given the narrow plot on which the hotel was built this is understandable, but it does mean one at times would be waiting for a lift to come for quite some time, and once in it, the lift would stop frequently before reaching its destination.

Another bonus was that we arrived at around 9:30am after flying in from London expecting to just be able to drop our bags off, but we were super lucky to be able to access our room straight away, which we were very grateful for as we were exhausted!","The only issue we had was that on two occasions, we had people access our room (who were not coming to clean the room) whilst we were in it. The first was a maintenance man who rang the doorbell a few times and entered whilst we were asleep during the day, who apparently had been told that the room was empty. The second happened when I was alone in the room at around 7:30am, someone knocked once and entered the room quickly after. Both of the people quickly backed out when they realised someone was in the room, but it was a little unsettling. I raised the issue with someone on reception who didn’t seem interested but said they would look into it, but I didn’t hear anything back from them.

I had to sit on a towel on the concrete under the eaves to supervise my children and the next day all the chairs were taken with sleeping guests so we had to leave our room key and phone on another towel against the wall.

The rooms are large, and there are facilities for cooking, fridge, and laundry. The pool looks nice though I didn't use it.  It's very secure, with card entry to every interior of the building. There are two blocks to the site.   I arrived after 10pm and though the reception had closed, there was a night security officer who handled the check in process efficiently.  Location is a bit so, so. It's a 10 minute walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT and a 12 minute walk to Outram Park MRT.  I suggest Tanjong Pagar because the walking path towards the other MRT isn't well paved at certain parts of the way. The walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT is ok, but you will have to walk through construction sites at the time I was there i.e. Sept 2023.","I booked a medium sized room for Sept 2023. I arrived late at night and the Taxi driver wasn't sure how to get into the building. Signage is poor and as the place isn't well known, getting into the building is a hit and miss.  The site isn't well lit and we were uncertain about where to go. There are 2 blocks to the site. The block away from the barrier entry is the one you want to go to.  This is supposed to be a non-smoking place, but the minute I entered the room, an upsetting pong of stale smoke engulfed me. I complained to the night security but he couldn't do anything. They could've at least upgraded me for one night to a room elsewhere, but since he didn't have the authority, he offered me a can of room spray. He was helpful but this kind of situation should have been solved instead of submitting a guest to a stifling air. That was an unpleasant first night especially since the windows could not be opened.   However, they changed my room the next day quite effectively. But no apologies were offered.   Nothing else to complain about but do take note that this is a shared-resources facility, there is a communal kitchen on each level and is located towards one end of the block. This means if your room is on the other end, it'll be a long walk just to make coffee. Fridge space is also a premium. Don't expect any mini fridge or kettle in the room, unless you are living in one of the larger apartments. The TV is smart but there are no free to air TV channels to watch.  Finally, the gardens are a bit unkempt. Long grasses mar the general positive feel of the entire facility.",01/11/2023,11/02/2024

Habyt Cantonment - formerly Hmlet Cantonment,Pauline,France,The Small Room,14.0,2022-10-01,Couple,Place is great but you might be unlucky with other guests,8.0,"I particularly enjoyed the location, it’s very close to a Donki, which provides cheap quality Japanese food.There are plenty of room and equipment to cook, everything is clean, and there are a lot of amenities.","First of all, the biggest issue : this place is really good but there is a major drawback that is sadly out of its control : guest’s behavior.Some people are really nice but some guests are clearly not used to live in shared space and will have a very individualistic and selfish behavior, when it’s not just plain rude to other guests.For instance, some guests will not care whether the dishwasher is clean or not, and will simply throw their dishes inside, when they don’t just let it in the sink for the staff to wash after them. The dishwasher has a sticker on it to indicate if it’s clean or dirty, and people will disregard it.The lack of forks is rather disturbing (so is the lack of chopsticks) but we learned that the problem is not that the hostel doesn’t provide guests with forks, but rather that guests, fearing that there are no clean forks when they come to have lunch or dinner, will take them in their room, just to be sure to have access to them. Pretty individualistic behavior, as I stated earlier.Lastly, the “common working area” is very great, but again, some guests seem to have no issue with letting their kids run around and scream, providing difficult working conditions.The staff doesn’t do much to help, they will no go out of their way to resolve these situations or enforce the rules, but they are really nice to talk to.",25/10/2022,11/02/2024

Habyt Cantonment - formerly Hmlet Cantonment,Shelley,South Africa,The Medium Room,15.0,2022-10-01,Couple,Very good,8.0,"Had such a great 2 week stay at Hmlet. Perfectly situated and great walking distance of MRTs, bus stops and food spots. 7eleven and Fair Price not too far either. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the medium room, which is perfect size for a couple. We almost chose the Small, but glad we didn't as I think it would have been too cramped for 2 people sharing. Amenities are great. Very central to most major attractions of Singapore, and if the attraction isn't close by, the MRT or bus routes get you to anywhere you want to be in no time. Grabs are also reasonably priced to most locations. About a 15-20 minute ride from Changi Airport. Will definitely stay here again when staying in Singapore.","Not much, but only thing I didn't like is the fact that the shower doesn't have a water panel to stop the water from running out to the rest of the bathroom floor. It constantly created a mess, so the floor was always wet. I wish they would have a small barrier for the water. House keeping times/days are also very confusing as some days we didn't have enough toilet paper because they didn't always come a replenish the towels and toilet paper, so we had to go and get some in the general wash wash room/gym washroom as there is extra there.  Because the coffee machine is very poplar, sugar and coffee and cups were sometimes scarce and on our last few days there was no sugar. So if you are staying long, be sure to buy your own cheap cups and spoons and a small sugar to keep in your room just incase they run out. Also, be sure to bring bug repellent and a good cream for insect bites.",19/10/2022,11/02/2024

I could hear flushing sounds and screaming from the room above us. Morning hours are especially bad so maybe bring some ear buds with you.- Windows are sealed shut (which helps greatly with keeping the bugs from coming in) but also makes the room very stuffy quickly.

Now to the wonderful team looking after you - fabulous hospitality and professionalism. Everybody who we met was so lovely and helpful. Dendry helped us enormously, our flights were an issue with ongoing delays, he made sure we were accommodated last minute when we firstly extended our checkout (small additional charge), then we had to make it an extra night and that additional cost was absorbed into the next night's rate.

Doing the pre-registration online made it a breeze when we arrived and we were checked in in less than 5 minutes.  Our beautiful room was well appointed, spotlessly clean, and had an awesome spa like washroom.  The bed was very comfortable and had nice bedding, and an option for spelt pillows to be delivered to the room.  Although we didn't have a view there was so much attention to detail in the layout that it made this smaller sized room meet our needs to a T.  There was a well stocked coffee bar area, and small bar fridge, and we had bottled water each day.   The desk and work area were comfortable and had good lighting.  There night lights on either side of the bed which were very helpful.  There was a wall safe, good sized closet with lots of hangers, ironing board, iron, hair dryer, spa styled huge fluffy bath towels, housecoats and slippers and a wonderful selection of toiletry items.  The smart tv was easy to access and use.  There were switches inside the room that you could light up to have maid service or do not disturb, that we found unique and practical as well as an energy efficient key system.   The hotel felt safe and secure and was quiet.We ate breakfast twice in the Market Restaurant on the lower floor and it was excellent.  It wasn't that expensive, in terms of Singapore prices and the huge buffet offered a variety of breakfast foods and wonderful coffee service.  Both the bar area by the pool and inside the lobby were well laid out and the staff were attentive and very helpful.   One of the biggest pluses was the hotel's close proximity to  Clarke Quay.  The promenade felt very safe and had a huge assortment of restaurants, pubs, and entertainment within a two minute walk.  Easy access to the city bus system was also a plus and we were able to access the Big Bus tour pickup with just a short walk.  Loved this!","We didn't have any negatives and have no suggestions for improvement.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would stay here again should we be in Singapore again.  From the moment we arrived by cab our service was excellent, and the all the staff from the door people, registration, maid service, bar servers and restaurant staff were all helpful, friendly, spoke good English and they were very attentive to our questions and needs.  Next visit I would make sure I brought at least 3 electrical adapters for charging and using curling irons etc.  I'm sure if we asked they would have supplied us with a couple.",06/11/2023,11/02/2024

There's no space in the shower, very little room for your luggage and the roof in the ""upper floor"" is low.

My only complaint would be the long washing times of the washing machines, though I did appreciate they had (several of) the machines and driers in the first place.Before booking make sure you've read through all the limitations of using the apartment as there's quite a few of them and the rules are stricter than what you would have in most hotels.",14/01/2023,11/02/2024

The staff were friendly via their Whatsapp service and responded quickly.,"The windows were frosted so there was no view.  The loft with the bed was too short to stand in.  The self check in process was overly complicated and required you to download apps, read reams of information, watch videos on Youtube and set your phone in specific ways in order to access the lift,door and check in check out.  All you want to do is get a key card and go to your room. People do not want to invest so much time into a task that should be no effort. Also the need to use your phone to operate the lift and open your door created a constant worry that I would run out of phone battery, so i had to carry around a phone charger every day. The requirement for a 300sgd charge to your card  as a security deposit is also very inconvenient.  You can only do this when you arrive at the property.  Another laborious task.  For me I had to change sim cards and try several cards.  With todays bank card security policies, it is not that easy to get a OTP to authorise an online transaction while you are travelling overseas.

Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena,Beautique,Philippines,Guest Room King ,2.0,2022-09-01,Family,DISAPPOINTING. WILL NEVER CHECK IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN. WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE,1.0,"Nothing extra-ordinary with this hotel to pay  S$1,427.34 for 2 nights for 3 pax. I had the worst hotel experience in this hotel. The staff are cold and impolite, and my sons said they are rude. Aside from the problem we encountered during check-in, wherein I was compelled to book another room (staff said it is the fault of Booking.com} we also had issue with breakfast, I reserved for 4 pax (for my 2 sons and business partner who came over for a meeting) because they offered a discounted rate of S$25 per pax when we checked in. While we were having breakfast, the restaurant staff informed me that only 2 were reserved and I had to pay $36/pax for the other 2.  Imagine, in the middle of having breakfast, the staff will tell me that. I totally lost my appetite.  It is just a matter of 11 dollars but to tell me that in the middle of breakfast, that is unacceptable and unprofessional. And I have not moved on for paying additional S$758 for another room, whereinfact I saw at Booking.com that they really have that option.  They are NOT ORGANIZED to the expense of causing inconvenience to the customer. WE TOTALLY REGRET STAYING AT THIS HOTEL.","I had the worst hotel experience from this hotel in my entire life. We flew in to Singapore very early, arrived in the hotel at around 3 AM, taking our chances of an early check in. I was with my 2 sons for business and pleasure. When we arrived at the hotel, we were asked if we checking in together, no Good morning or how are you? I was informed that we need 2 book 2 rooms to accomodate 3 pax.I told the hotel staff that I booked the extra large king size room because I saw when I browsed Booking.com that that particular room sleeps 3 adult. The staff informed me that the hotel has small rooms and I said it is okay since we will be out most of the time, all we need is a clean, safe place to sleep and bathe, and I am willing to  pay extra. But according to the staff, it is hotel policy just 2 pax per room. I told her how come booking.com had the option of 3 pax in their hotel (see photo.attached),the staff insisted they can't do that. I was getting irritated already because of the attitude of the staff. My sons even told me the staffs are rude, which I believe is true. It was my youngest son's birthday and I do not want to upset him since part of the trip is his celebration. If I cancel our booking and transfer to another hotel which when I checked can sleep 3 pax (a 5 star hotel at a price lower than this hotel), I will forfeit my 1 night which is about S$350.00. And besides, I can see the disappointment already in my sons's face. I was compelled to book another room and I asked if it is possible to have an early check in. Again, in a cold manner, the staff informed me that it is not possible, the hotel is fully booked, we can check in at 3PM. So we decided to stay in the lounge for a couple of hours for the restaurants to open for breakfast. At around 4:30 AM a couple of what looked like locals arrived for check-in. So I asked, how come when we requested for early check-in, the staff said they are fully booked. The staff said they are using points.",28/09/2022,11/02/2024

Dangerous,1.0,I liked nothing. This is the worst hostel I've ever stayed in. It was a nightmare.  Avoid at all costs.,"Nightmare.  Avoid this place at all costs. Worst hostel I've ever stayed in.  It's filthy, squalid, and shockingly bad. I have reported the hostel to the Singapore health authorities, and have followed up on the report. I hope that Singapore government shuts it down. It's beyond scary.  It is by far the filthiest hostel I have ever stayed in.* The common facilities are disgusting.* The urinals are broken and covered in plastic bags.* The floors and surfaces were filthy with brown or black sticky substances. Staff made little effort to clean common areas. They just hosed down the washrooms with water and let it air dry without actually making a cleaning effort.* There were two male showers.  One was broken, and the other hand a mold or termite eaten wood sill that had used bandaids stuck into its holes.* The sink was clogged and had a pool of yellow liquid and possibly snot in it.* The male washroom door was perpetually propped open with a string cord so that some guests could dry their clothes, thereby violating any sense modesty of those using the showers as well as women passing by the door.* The soap dispensers are broken.* There was a pool of vomit on the table which was left overnight to dry.* There were guests / squatters sleeping on each of the couches throughout the hostel; I saw at least 4 squatters.* The room itself had a leaky aircon pipe which dripped ice water on me as I tried to sleep.* There were used bandaids wedged into the shower and a used rusty razor blade shoved into the shower's water heater.The hostel attracted the worst people, and most inconsiderate roommates. Guests take calls and speak loudly at all hours.  One roommate took a call at 3am and spoke loudly for 30 minutes. Another roommate woke up at 6am and turned on overhead light and kept it on for over an hour before I left to change hostels.Staff was unhelpful.",03/07/2022,11/02/2024

It’s not like other hostels Where you can get socially connected but worth the money if you like ur own company.,"I low-key didn’ like the location but only because there wasn’t enough space for drop off or pick up. other than that, everything was pretty okay. there was a shopping mall nearby and a MRT station few blocks away which is still considered good. but the cleaning was not really good at all. washroom was always dirty. even though i complained to the lady, she didn’ take any action. the room had dust mostly which comes to ur pod if ur shade is open. on top of that, if you want younger people to hangout with as a solo traveler and chill then this is not what you’re looking for but enjoying own company or if u stay outside most of the time, then Its a cool place to stay for few days.",21/01/2023,11/02/2024
