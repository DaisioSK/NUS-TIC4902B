I like water purifier the most as I don't need to order water from the guest services, I just have to fill in the purifier to have a potable water.  I also like the washer/dryer, we didn't pack a lot of clothes and utilized the washer/dryer -- takes around 4 hrs per load, but you can leave it open while you're away.It is very near MRT station from Red/Green line and Blue line. Very accessible since it is in the heart of the city.Very near Lau Pa Sat for food.",The room smells old.The living room TV wifi is flaky.The TV in the bedroom had no wifi and the off switch from the remote doesn't work.

Elevator tunnel was very close to my room and its operational noise kept on waking me up whole night5. No water bottles in room for coffee making.

Ascott Raffles Place Singapore,Sheryl,United States,Cutler Suite,2 nights · November 2023,Couple,"Great location, wonderful staff, nice hotel",9,"The Ascott Raffles Singapore is a wonderful hotel. The staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and modern, and the kitchen facilities came in handy. We had a nice view from a high floor. (See photos.) The location was in the business district, so there weren't a lot of restaurants around there and things were pretty quiet over the weekend, but it was in a great location. We were two blocks from the market with the hawker food stalls, and the metro was right across the street.  Because we were centrally located, we were able to walk to the Gardens on the Bay, The Marina Sands, the river/bay areas,  and Chinatown.  Our flight out of Singapore was very late and we had to check out of our room around noon, but there was a nice room available for lounging, watching TV, snacking, etc. that was available to us after we checked out.  The receptionist also said we could have access to the pool and shower facilities if we needed it after check out.","There were some issues with maintenance in our room. There had been some sort of leak from the bathroom and some of the floorboards just outside the bath were buckled, making it a bit dangerous for bare feet. Also, the door trim at the bath door was rotted, probably from the leak. It may have been an isolated incident in this particular room, but these sorts of things were unsightly, unsafe, and should have been repaired, particularly in a hotel of this caliber.  The AC worked well, but there wasn't a way to turn off the fan without turning off the air conditioner completely. It would have been nice to have the automatic style AC that shuts the fan off when the room gets to the proper temperature. The bed was a bit too firm for my tastes, but otherwise the room was comfortable.",Reviewed: 10 November 2023,2024-02-10T15:54:25.061Z

The gym area and the lounge are very good, and our suite was very spacious.","In our room I’m sad to say there was some dirt and fluff in numerous areas - particularly in an old magazine rack in the toilet it was full of fluff and dirt missed by the cleaners. Also there was loose things in the room some plugs, the shower head, spotlights were loose. These are all easily fixed so don’t worry about these things the rest of the room is big and very spacious and modern layout. The biggest two criticisms are 1) the bed feels like a slab of wood. Honestly my back was killing me on this bed, so hard and uncomfortable. To be fair I just toughed it out and I’m sure you could ask for a softer mattress topper or something the staff are extremely helpful. But, the air conditioners seriously need an update. They are as loud as a car engine at night, I need it on because I’m from Britain and we are used to cooler nights but I had to buy earplugs and even then I struggled to sleep.

Upon arrival, I asked about where we were to eat breakfast and the young lady rudely said, ""It's 48.00 plus tax and not included!""  I have no clue what prompted that response.  I wanted to confirm it was feather free.  She said I hadn't requested it.  I requested ""allergy free!"" Excuse me, but most people with severe allergies are allergic to feathers.  She wisely went for the manager, and he was very amenable.  He even offered a free dinner while we had to wait for our room to be ready.

The standard rooms are now much bigger, and the upgraded touches have been carried out with sensitivity and care.  It was so much fun to have electronically controlled curtains that scroll back to reveal the skyline when you enter the room.  Service here was exceptional. All staff we encountered were just really professional and courteous. We tried - the room service, the Chinese restaurant, the spa, breakfast, tea, pool facilities, as well as the ground floor bar, so we had a good chance to review and assess. Something different here we noticed at the Four Seasons - they have a Director of Quality Assurance, who is there to troubleshoot, and ensure the overall experience is exactly what each guest needs. This is a hotel I am most likely to return to next time I am in Singapore.","No major quibbles.

It's quite lively as there's alot of people coming in and out. Quite a youthful crowd and a really nice funky, unique space to be in.Comfortable enough place for a short stay in Singapore if you're going to be moving around.","Room is quite tight with the bed against the wall. The A/C gave the room a bit of a damp smell, and the duvet had some mould inside. We didn't make a complaint, as we were only there for a short time, so we're not sure about how they would have handled that. (Hopefully well).

There’s a small shop for snacks and drinks and we could leave our luggage for free at the hotel after check-out until the evening when our flight was. The location isn’t in the center but there’s a metro station really close by (1 to 2 min walking distance) which makes getting around very easy and convenient and you can reach downtown very quickly! :),"This is only a minor detail but our room was on the same level as the pool and unfortunately our window was directly facing the way to the pool, which meant that everyone walking by would stare directly into our room.

The check in process was super easy. Staff were very professional and customer service was top notch. Were lucky enough to get two room close to each other due to busy time. Garden view rooms were SPECTACULAR!! My mum who just rested in the room during our stay was able to admire the gardens by the bay and night view from the room. Big space in the room, balcony has a good set up to relax outside. Bathroom was very big and spacious.Infinity pool and spas at the top were the highlight. Like floating in the sky in such a beautiful city. One night was perfect amount of time to enjoy the hotel.","Our bathroom was not cleaned properly on arrival. There was still hair on the tiles and blood on the toilet seat from previous guests which was disappointing considering the amount we paid. Called room service to inform them. After leaving the room so they could clean it, went to the observatory deck, we came back an hour later after it had been cleaned only to realise they did not clean what was needed, still hair on the ground and blood on the toilet...not sure how that could be missed!! Called room service again and this time stayed in the room while they cleaned and showed them what we indicated over the phone had not been done. They were very good about it and we didn't make a big fuss or complain. Cleaned it all in the end well the 2nd round but I do have to wonder if their cleaning process is quite surface level...my sister and I were confused how you can miss blood around and on the toilet...That was the only disappointing part of the experience but still, infinity pool outshines it and would stay again!

My husband got his meal and finished it, then we were asked to pay, and had to say that I hadn't received mine yet.

Upon check-in, she was sharp to observe my kids were big despite their age and upgraded us to their Skyline room with a bathtub. That was excellent! So impressed that I extended another night. Hotel was designed to have all rooms facing the south. Awesome choice; morning sun, great skyline view and you won't miss the evening sun.Housekeeping was prompt when I requested for an extra blanket. On our 2nd day, housekeeper asked if we needed our rooms to be cleaned and I thought it was fine to just clear the rubbish but he cleaned up almost everything and changed new towels (we declined on the bedsheets). Awesome service.Amenities wise; Olympic sized pool, Adequate gym (missing dumbbells and only 2 kettlebells but no issues with this) with new and well taken care equipment. We cycled from Boon Lay and they ensured our bikes were well stored yet easily accessible. Can't comment on the food as we could only consume halal. BUT, it was right in the heart of Little India. Our favourite places Mustafa, Sakunthala and City Square were nearby. And literally sheltered as you can go via the MRT underpass. 7-11 and Killiney Kopitiam right by the hotel.Can't find another hotel with1) Affordable price yet classy ambience, 2) great location with awesome food all around,3) awesome amenities, 4) within cycling distance to Orchard, Marina Bay and ECP.OneFarrer, you stole my family's heart. We were supposed to cycle around to 'explore' Town in the night but my family literally sank in the hotel's ambience and no one wanted to get out except to eat lunch once at City Square.God's willing, we're already planning for a comeback in Dec.",Literally none! My wife and I can be fussy when it comes to choosing hotels and resorts more so since it's local and you're forking out money just to stay locally elsewhere.,Reviewed: 9 September 2021,2024-02-10T12:02:15.947Z

The competition is fierce in Singapore amongst the rooftops and with Sands only 5 minutes away this stupid attitude must be revised....we will mot return until that is the case.It seemed as if the staff were embarrassed to tell us about the rooftop rules when we confronted them and they tried to apologies the idea of having a superior rooftop........,Reviewed: 7 February 2024,2024-02-10T11:50:50.723Z

They were great haircuts too!","The room didn’t have enough space to hang or keep your clothes.  There was a tiny rail with only 4-5 hangers.  The rest of the clothes had to stay in the suitcase.  The suitcase area was in the bathroom which wasn’t ideal because of the steam when you had a shower.  The buffet for breakfast and lunch was expensive.  The service in that restaurant was not great.  At one point we reached our assigned table and there was still a small jug of milk sitting there.  We ordered tea, advised that jug of milk wasn’t mine and could I please have a fresh one.  When we walked away to get our food from the buffet, the lady looked around then sneakily put the old jug of milk back on the table and walked off.

Check-in service was great and was severed by a very friendly & motivated staff. The location of the Hotel is great when you have to go to Suntec city or even MBS, everything is in walking distance and the MRT is also close by. The view from the rooms are just stunning.","Unfortunately, the AC-only ventilation in the rooms wasn't my cup of tea, and there was a noticeable lingering smell. Maintenance seemed a bit overlooked; the shower water flow issue turned the whole floor into a wet zone.The primary concern lies in the check out process, a crucial and lasting impression on guests. Unfortunately they were disorganised and inefficient. Hotels are well-aware of peak hours and check out times, which just leads to the conclusion that the management has not effectively streamlined its operations. Using Covid as an excuse for the failed management just outlines the failure of the management to train its employees correctly. Express check-outs, self check in services are not preferred nor wanted by guests, which the hotel can clearly see from their daily operations. Employees should appreciate that guests prefer the human interaction, as the implementation of AI and digitalisation will diminish their requirements to perform this job. Indicating for job security you should not only be more organised but more motivated to provide a service. Failing to do so, jeopardises your job and this will come faster than an employee might think. Hence more personal interactions, improved and organised service are not only required, but surely wanted from the majority of the guests.",Reviewed: 29 January 2024,2024-02-10T11:50:59.285Z

It's big and comfy.I like the lazy sofa that allows me to fall asleep while watching tV. The TV was able to mirror screen. Awesome for nexflix from my phone. The house keeping crew were young, hip and of different nationalities and they were hospitable. There is a nespresso machine but limited stock. There is sugar packs but i think its a bit too little. Only 3. Hence, my coffee was bitter. The bed and bedspread were clean. I like the elevator. It gave a nostalgic feeling. The room service food were awesome and the room service crew were great.","I don't like the Balmin shampoo, conditioners and body wash gel, and lotion. It smell old and not nice. The bottle shampoo/wash/conditioner dispenser have small opening hence it have out a little and difficult to press. The Mini fridge is fully stock. But maybe can lessen abit. So if I were to buy some drinks outside I can put it in. - sorry need to save some cost.I dont like the person who register me in.

When we went to the buffet for breakfast at 10:30 we were told to hurry up and grab what we wanted since they were closing, although it was supposed to be open until 11.  We barely got any food as they started picking things up as we were approaching the counters. When we asked the staff where the juice was, they would simply point at the area, but when we got there, there was nothing left. This is not the type of service expected at a 5 star resort!The food options were limited, especially for vegetarians.  Also, there were no casual dining options.

Great housekeeping service! Great welcome surprise for us as well!  :)","Breakfast is quite unaffordable at $50/day pp - approx $200 for a family of 4 per day - i think is unreasonable when you can go out for $20/family in Singapore as we eat so little. If they could offer breakfast for $50/family, i think we would consider that. Rooms were a bit dated but well maintained, and clean. Bed size was excellent but its the firm type - a bit uncomfortable for us.

Really thoughtful little gifts for the kids as well - the mini room slippers were one-of-a-kind and the joy it brought was priceless - not smth you'd usually think of getting as a parent but my toddler absolutely loved it.Room generously big by Singapore standards (for 4 of us) and the sofa bed even served as a toddler's bed at a perfect height and size with large armrests to prevent falling off. The hotel itself is timeless and insanely luxurious. From the moment you step in it doesn't even feel like Singapore, let alone a space near Orchard Rd. Breathtaking (for us, literally) size to walk through although you'd be amazed at the landscaping effort put in. Kids loved walking past the many(!) waterfalls and it felt more like an overseas holiday than a staycation. Which we badly needed with the kids :D",Just the carpark - highly advised to drop *all* luggage and kids off before parking because there are steps and space is tight between parked cars.,Reviewed: 23 May 2023,2024-02-10T11:36:56.141Z

The rooms have recently been refurbished to a seriously high level. Anika at reception was super helpful and kindly upgraded us to a Heritage room which made the trip even more luxurious. We had delicious cocktails on the bay hotel rooftop bar Lantern. Highly recommend for the amazing view of the bay. The location is also great for getting into town compared to the Marina Bay Sands which does involve an extra 25 min walk around the bay. If you’re in Singapore for three nights and want to do Marina Bay Sands I would recommend one night there so you can enjoy the pool and view and then moving to the Fullerton for two nights or vice versa.,Nothing,Reviewed: 11 January 2024,2024-02-10T11:20:37.070Z

It is perfectly located on the river and is central to the city. The breakfasts were incredible, service excellent and the pool area busy but beautiful.","We were upgraded to a larger room, one that was river facing but we were on the level with the cement balastrade so we had a pretty unattractive view of a cement courtyard  ( like a prison exercise area , high cement wall blocking the view and light with no outlook or ambiance. ) You certainly would not sit out there. We were happy with the larger room and kept the curtains closed, it was too hot to sit outside anyway. We had dinner on the terrace outside in the restaurant on the night we arrived. Very slow service, average and overpriced food and drinks. I think the waitress' outfits make them look like street cleaners, nothing crisp or chic about their uniforms. The staff looked tired and overworked and their english very basic so they could not understand when we complained that my dinner arrived 20 mins before my husbands.

From check in to check out all the staff we encountered were so lovely and helpful and patient (important as we were travelling with energetic children). The kids loved getting a balloon and lollypop at check in, then the bracelet for free ice cream in the afternoons was a hit. After check in they also brought us up slippers and children dental kits which the kids loved. When the kids found out the pool was 24 hrs they were so excited. We had a late night swim (around 9pm) and it was beautiful, the lights from the hotel and gardens made for a beautiful setting. The rooms were beautiful (we had a fabulous twin and fabulous king) and so roomy. Bathrooms were huge! Buffet breakfast was one of the best we have ever been to. Everything was so fresh, coffee's made to order, select meals that could be ordered fresh as part of the buffet, even a pour your own bloody mary section. The breakfast was a hit with the kids and adults. We loved the pool during the day, plenty of sun lounges and shady seats. Swim up bar, water slide, hammocks, honestly we were blown away. Check out was smooth. We were even able to have complimentary late checkout on one of our rooms so we could enjoy the pool longer. Restaurants and bar on site and also plenty within walking distance. I wish we had stayed longer than 1 night and we can't wait to come back","The only thing we could fault is that the location is a bit secluded so if you're planning to do all the touristy things at Sentosa (beaches, resorts world etc) it's not part of the beach shuttle and monorail area. We had done all that already so we were able to just relax and enjoy all the W had to offer. We would pick this as our last spot to stay next time we come back to Singapore and book 3 or 4 days to just relax and enjoy ourselves",Reviewed: 25 October 2023,2024-02-10T11:43:30.161Z

Capella Singapore,Robbie,Singapore,Sentosa Suite,4 nights · June 2021,Couple,"Beautiful quiet resort that's great for rejuvenation, attentive and efficient staff",10,"This was our third stay at the Capella.  We were celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary, and got one of the Sentosa Suites.  Covid restrictions meant that the restaurants were all closed, so we had to have room service instead.   The room service menu was quite extensive and we had no trouble finding things to eat over 4 days, and the food was generally very good.  As always we enjoyed the wonderful quiet resort atmosphere of the Capella.  The Sentosa Suite was large and comfortable - I actually prefer this layout, with the square-ish recessed balcony (as compared to the elongated balcony in the seaview rooms, which run the breadth of the room) - it feels more private and secluded, and stays drier when there is heavy rain (which happened on one of the days of our stay).  In addition to the wonderful suite and the quiet resort feel, the service at the Capella also deserves special mention.  They liaised with us before check-in, were able to accommodate our request for early check-in, the whole check-in process was painless and smooth, and the express check-out also meant that we were out of the room and in our car in about 5 minutes.  The hotel really spoilt us with tea goodies and snacks every day, and also gave us special amenities for our anniversary.  Anytime you need anything, you can just call and they will send someone to replenish your drinks or snacks, clean your room, or anything else you need.  Really superlative service, which is one of the hallmarks of the great hotels.","These are really minor points, but at this level of the great hotels, even small details matter.  There was a connecting door in our living room (to the room next door), and the soundproofing could have been better.  The resort is generally very quiet and peaceful, so when we had quiet noisy kids in the next room, we could actually hear them shouting and playing next door.  I'm sure they were just letting off steam, and they only stayed 1 night, but it was a surprise that the suite had a connecting door (they disguise it behind heavy sliding wooden panels), and that the soundproofing wasn't that fantastic.  The other little thing is that the tap design is completely round and smooth - modernist and pretty to look at, but hard to turn when your hand is soapy or even wet.  As I said, these are small things that didn't materially affect our stay, but at this level of hotel, even the small details matter.",Reviewed: 21 June 2021,2024-02-11T04:42:10.762Z

For the room, the aircon seemed to be non-inverter type, as it suddenly stopped after a while (i.e. no wind circulation from the fan also), then switched on again, causing hot/cold periods.

We had a couple of issues during our stay eg… had an issue with the washing machine, was sorted within an hour of contacting reception. Room cleaned to a high standard. Location suited our needs, it’s not close to the city, but getting a taxi is very easy. Can’t say what other transport is like, eg… bus, MRT, because we either walked or went by taxi. Supermarket open very early till 11pm, so convenient for the groceries we needed. The pool area is lovely, only had the opportunity to use it once. It’s kept clean and well maintained. Our room - the only thing that was missing was balcony furniture. The room was advertised as having a table and chairs, but none were there. If we’d spent more time at the hotel we would have asked about this. The room was a good size for two people. The bathroom was very open to view from the bedroom, with only glass partitions separating the two - no door. There were a couple of blinds to pull down adding limited privacy. There was however a separate toilet off the kitchen for the bashful.Kitchen was equipped for two people. No oven - but a microwave, toaster and two ring hob. Would definitely stay here again 🙂","A small coffee table in the lounge area would be good, we had one large round pouffe in our room.Plus as mentioned before the outdoor table and chairs for the balcony.",Reviewed: 9 March 2023,2024-02-11T06:01:23.826Z

Just the right size for us and at a pretty good rate too. Rooms are very quiet. No noise from inside or outside the property comes through. There were lots of pets too and we did not hear a single barking dog so there must be some good sound deadening going on. Staff on site are helpful and welcoming. Facilities are great although you have to book your slots in advance. That is one thing I hope stays after, whenever after will be, COVID. Booking a slot for the pool and jacuzzi in particular just makes sense. Prevents over crowding and gives certainty. The rooms themselves have a modern feel with big shower and comfortable bedding. The children slept well in the two single beds and were happy in their own room. A good kitchenette with large fridge and proper stove, ovens for a service apartment, made home cooking a breeze. Locality is great with posh supermarket downstairs and a fair price too. One of Singapore’s best pizza restaurants and a decent burger joint as well as yoga studio are great. Lots of local busses from just across the street or the in house shuttle is a good service we used a lot too. Highly recommend.",Plenty!,Reviewed: 31 July 2021,2024-02-11T06:03:00.844Z

I had to follow this up with the hotel and the transaction didn't get cancelled for a whole week. If you plan to pay via booking.com, make sure you have ample extra money on your card as you might get charged twice. In saying that the hotel did a good job at promptly replying to my issue. Another minor point, I'm just being picky at this point, was the smell of the rooms. They've obviously been newly renovated so the smell of fresh plaster and paint is still prevalent. Also, the hotel does well and truly inform you but there was still renovations going on. Don't plan a red eye flight if you can avoid it as it (what I can only assume was jack-hammering) didn't stop until about 3pm.

We had booked a suite and paid premium prices for it. But almost immediately after arrival the problems began. The power repeatedly cut out in the room, sometimes for hours at a time. We were without power overnight for most of the night. Finally, the hotel switched our room. We were given a smaller room. The phone didn’t work in this room either and the hotel couldn’t fix it. We were not offered service recovery until we explicitly asked for it.  Even then, all that was offered was the taxi fare to the airport, which would have cost the hotel about $25. There was no real attempt to make an apology. Given the extent of the problems with the two rooms and the price we paid, I would say this is substandard. It’s rather shocking the hotel is selling rooms with no reliable source of power.

The bed is a semi-sofa in the day and needs to be let down (by button push) to sleep, because you wouldn't be able to walk around the room otherwise. This also means you have almost no room to stow your stuff, so travel light. This hotel is not for long stays.Air conditioning is a bit agressive.

The hotel is very centrally located and the greenery brought a very calming environment.,"We had a few small issues and felt communication could have been better.  The lock on one of our rooms would not open and needed to be repaired.  After reporting it to the reception staff and them checking it themselves we waited over an hour with no update - our children were waiting to go for a swim but could not as their items were all in the room.  After going back to reception to check on the update (and after some confusion among the staff) we were told the repair would take another hour.  When the door was finally fixed an hour later we went back to the room only to find all the debris from the work sitting on the floor.  So we had to call reception and wait again for 1/2 hour for this to be remedied.  We were offered a late check out as an apology which was very much appreciated, but on the final day our keycards stopped working and so we had to go back to reception to get this remedied.",Reviewed: 7 October 2023,2024-02-11T06:27:23.881Z

The pillows in my hotel room bedroom were phenomenal. I would recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone.","The building is a thin, 30 story structure with only four lifts located around a central core. Given the narrow plot on which the hotel was built this is understandable, but it does mean one at times would be waiting for a lift to come for quite some time, and once in it, the lift would stop frequently before reaching its destination. Unfortunately I don't think there is any feasible way for The Clan Hotel to fix this, short of using AI/lift programming to make their movements more efficient.

The Clan Hotel Singapore by Far East Hospitality,Shrena,New Zealand,Deluxe Room,3 nights · January 2024,Couple,Superb,9,"The hotel is stunning and is an excellent location. The room had everything we needed, even though it was on the smaller side. Staff were mostly very friendly and helpful and the pool on the rooftop was amazing! Another bonus was that we arrived at around 9:30am after flying in from London expecting to just be able to drop our bags off, but we were super lucky to be able to access our room straight away, which we were very grateful for as we were exhausted!","The only issue we had was that on two occasions, we had people access our room (who were not coming to clean the room) whilst we were in it. The first was a maintenance man who rang the doorbell a few times and entered whilst we were asleep during the day, who apparently had been told that the room was empty. The second happened when I was alone in the room at around 7:30am, someone knocked once and entered the room quickly after. Both of the people quickly backed out when they realised someone was in the room, but it was a little unsettling. I raised the issue with someone on reception who didn’t seem interested but said they would look into it, but I didn’t hear anything back from them. Overall we had a great stay, but these incidents did tarnish our stay somewhat, especially as staying in such a nice hotel is not a regular thing for us.",Reviewed: 19 January 2024,2024-02-11T06:39:40.046Z

Definitely recommend.","The only thing we didn't like about our stay was the ""fine dining"" dinner at Qin. The food was superb, but the service was severely lacking. The first 3 courses were done in ~15 minutes and the whole dinner (6 courses) in ~40 minutes, which is super fast. Waiter interrupted us during the dessert to ask how we were going to pay, and she announced her arrival 2 tables away from us. And when we wanted to finish with Singapore Sling, they said they ran out (1hr before closing).",Reviewed: 19 January 2024,2024-02-11T06:39:40.046Z

I had to sit on a towel on the concrete under the eaves to supervise my children and the next day all the chairs were taken with sleeping guests so we had to leave our room key and phone on another towel against the wall. Perhaps a little shelf for people to store their stuff if all of the chairs are taken down those who would like to just swim or use the spa.

Habyt Cantonment - formerly Hmlet Cantonment,Sohkiak,Australia,The Medium Room,11 nights · September 2023,Solo traveller,Pleasant place for long stay with shared cooking and laundry facilities.,8,"It's my first time at the hotel. The rooms are large, and there are facilities for cooking, fridge, and laundry. The pool looks nice though I didn't use it.  It's very secure, with card entry to every interior of the building. There are two blocks to the site.   I arrived after 10pm and though the reception had closed, there was a night security officer who handled the check in process efficiently.  Location is a bit so, so. It's a 10 minute walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT and a 12 minute walk to Outram Park MRT.  I suggest Tanjong Pagar because the walking path towards the other MRT isn't well paved at certain parts of the way. The walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT is ok, but you will have to walk through construction sites at the time I was there i.e. Sept 2023.","I booked a medium sized room for Sept 2023. I arrived late at night and the Taxi driver wasn't sure how to get into the building. Signage is poor and as the place isn't well known, getting into the building is a hit and miss.  The site isn't well lit and we were uncertain about where to go. There are 2 blocks to the site. The block away from the barrier entry is the one you want to go to.  This is supposed to be a non-smoking place, but the minute I entered the room, an upsetting pong of stale smoke engulfed me. I complained to the night security but he couldn't do anything. They could've at least upgraded me for one night to a room elsewhere, but since he didn't have the authority, he offered me a can of room spray. He was helpful but this kind of situation should have been solved instead of submitting a guest to a stifling air. That was an unpleasant first night especially since the windows could not be opened.   However, they changed my room the next day quite effectively. But no apologies were offered.   Nothing else to complain about but do take note that this is a shared-resources facility, there is a communal kitchen on each level and is located towards one end of the block. This means if your room is on the other end, it'll be a long walk just to make coffee. Fridge space is also a premium. Don't expect any mini fridge or kettle in the room, unless you are living in one of the larger apartments. The TV is smart but there are no free to air TV channels to watch.  Finally, the gardens are a bit unkempt. Long grasses mar the general positive feel of the entire facility.",Reviewed: 1 November 2023,2024-02-11T06:45:25.837Z

The dishwasher has a sticker on it to indicate if it’s clean or dirty, and people will disregard it.The lack of forks is rather disturbing (so is the lack of chopsticks) but we learned that the problem is not that the hostel doesn’t provide guests with forks, but rather that guests, fearing that there are no clean forks when they come to have lunch or dinner, will take them in their room, just to be sure to have access to them. Pretty individualistic behavior, as I stated earlier.Lastly, the “common working area” is very great, but again, some guests seem to have no issue with letting their kids run around and scream, providing difficult working conditions.The staff doesn’t do much to help, they will no go out of their way to resolve these situations or enforce the rules, but they are really nice to talk to.",Reviewed: 25 October 2022,2024-02-11T06:46:38.083Z

Perfectly situated and great walking distance of MRTs, bus stops and food spots. 7eleven and Fair Price not too far either. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the medium room, which is perfect size for a couple. We almost chose the Small, but glad we didn't as I think it would have been too cramped for 2 people sharing. Amenities are great. Very central to most major attractions of Singapore, and if the attraction isn't close by, the MRT or bus routes get you to anywhere you want to be in no time. Grabs are also reasonably priced to most locations. About a 15-20 minute ride from Changi Airport. Will definitely stay here again when staying in Singapore.","Not much, but only thing I didn't like is the fact that the shower doesn't have a water panel to stop the water from running out to the rest of the bathroom floor. It constantly created a mess, so the floor was always wet. I wish they would have a small barrier for the water. House keeping times/days are also very confusing as some days we didn't have enough toilet paper because they didn't always come a replenish the towels and toilet paper, so we had to go and get some in the general wash wash room/gym washroom as there is extra there.  Because the coffee machine is very poplar, sugar and coffee and cups were sometimes scarce and on our last few days there was no sugar. So if you are staying long, be sure to buy your own cheap cups and spoons and a small sugar to keep in your room just incase they run out. Also, be sure to bring bug repellent and a good cream for insect bites.",Reviewed: 19 October 2022,2024-02-11T06:46:47.221Z

Habyt Cantonment - formerly Hmlet Cantonment,Sinnaura,United Arab Emirates,The Medium Room,6 nights · May 2022,Couple,It was okay but…,7,"- Nice layout and decor. Medium room was rather small for 2 people but it was fine, with some space to hang clothes and fold them in the drawers. There is also a tiny table with a chair, along with a mirror and some luggage space on the side of the room. There is a small safe for keeping personal items, pretty useful.- I appreciated that the bathroom had an extra paper roll and toiletries. There is a walk in shower with a glass partition, although it can get messy because there is no door.- The property has a lovely common working space (including a the reception desk) although it can smell a bit funky at times. Coffee, water and tables are readily available.- Our room was ready by the time we arrived, so we had an early check in.- Lovely security staff, helpful with letting us know where to dispose of the garbage.- Management fumigated the area and hotel to prevent bugs from coming in. Since there is currently a dengue situation, they were keen to make sure there were no mosquitos.- There is a mini mart right across from the accommodation.- The complex was once a school, cool layout.","- The cleanliness and overall hygiene left much to be desired. We noticed that the cleaning staff came by regularly but due to the room being small (and because of covid), we opted not to go with room service. However, the room had scuff marks all around, peeled paint and food stains on the table and night stand. The toilet seat was dirty and so I had to clean most of the room myself.- Staff were fine but seemed very disengaged. I believe there were 2 main members (albeit nice people) who seemed to struggle with management especially on the last day of our stay.- Incredibly loud door locks and lack of soundproofing. I could hear flushing sounds and screaming from the room above us. Morning hours are especially bad so maybe bring some ear buds with you.- Windows are sealed shut (which helps greatly with keeping the bugs from coming in) but also makes the room very stuffy quickly. There is no ventilation on the room so best keep the AC on.- 1st and 2nd floors were lovely but the 3rd floor (also including a common kitchen) was very stuffy, noisy and unhygienic.- Location would be excellent for Grab/taxi pickups and short rides to Sentosa, however, a walk to the MRT takes 10-15 mins and it can be very hot outside.

Now to the wonderful team looking after you - fabulous hospitality and professionalism. Everybody who we met was so lovely and helpful. Dendry helped us enormously, our flights were an issue with ongoing delays, he made sure we were accommodated last minute when we firstly extended our checkout (small additional charge), then we had to make it an extra night and that additional cost was absorbed into the next night's rate.

The hotel felt safe and secure and was quiet.We ate breakfast twice in the Market Restaurant on the lower floor and it was excellent.  It wasn't that expensive, in terms of Singapore prices and the huge buffet offered a variety of breakfast foods and wonderful coffee service.  Both the bar area by the pool and inside the lobby were well laid out and the staff were attentive and very helpful.   One of the biggest pluses was the hotel's close proximity to  Clarke Quay.  The promenade felt very safe and had a huge assortment of restaurants, pubs, and entertainment within a two minute walk.  Easy access to the city bus system was also a plus and we were able to access the Big Bus tour pickup with just a short walk.

From the moment we arrived by cab our service was excellent, and the all the staff from the door people, registration, maid service, bar servers and restaurant staff were all helpful, friendly, spoke good English and they were very attentive to our questions and needs.

The loft room was good for a short stay but probably a bit small for anything over 4 days.","There is no front-office or on site staff, so you need to fully check in online and use your phone and the hotel wifi to access your room key. Not too bad, but does mean you need to wait for a whatsapp reply from their staff to answer any questions or issues you have and may not be so accessible for those who aren't so good with technology.

The self check in process was overly complicated and required you to download apps, read reams of information, watch videos on Youtube and set your phone in specific ways in order to access the lift,door and check in check out.  All you want to do is get a key card and go to your room. People do not want to invest so much time into a task that should be no effort. Also the need to use your phone to operate the lift and open your door created a constant worry that I would run out of phone battery, so i had to carry around a phone charger every day. The requirement for a 300sgd charge to your card  as a security deposit is also very inconvenient.  You can only do this when you arrive at the property.  Another laborious task.  For me I had to change sim cards and try several cards.  With todays bank card security policies, it is not that easy to get a OTP to authorise an online transaction while you are travelling overseas.

Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena,Beautique,Philippines,Guest Room King ,2 nights · September 2022,Family,DISAPPOINTING. WILL NEVER CHECK IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN. WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE,1,"Nothing extra-ordinary with this hotel to pay  S$1,427.34 for 2 nights for 3 pax. I had the worst hotel experience in this hotel. The staff are cold and impolite, and my sons said they are rude. Aside from the problem we encountered during check-in, wherein I was compelled to book another room (staff said it is the fault of Booking.com} we also had issue with breakfast, I reserved for 4 pax (for my 2 sons and business partner who came over for a meeting) because they offered a discounted rate of S$25 per pax when we checked in. While we were having breakfast, the restaurant staff informed me that only 2 were reserved and I had to pay $36/pax for the other 2.  Imagine, in the middle of having breakfast, the staff will tell me that. I totally lost my appetite.  It is just a matter of 11 dollars but to tell me that in the middle of breakfast, that is unacceptable and unprofessional. And I have not moved on for paying additional S$758 for another room, whereinfact I saw at Booking.com that they really have that option.  They are NOT ORGANIZED to the expense of causing inconvenience to the customer. WE TOTALLY REGRET STAYING AT THIS HOTEL.","I had the worst hotel experience from this hotel in my entire life. We flew in to Singapore very early, arrived in the hotel at around 3 AM, taking our chances of an early check in. I was with my 2 sons for business and pleasure. When we arrived at the hotel, we were asked if we checking in together, no Good morning or how are you? I was informed that we need 2 book 2 rooms to accomodate 3 pax.I told the hotel staff that I booked the extra large king size room because I saw when I browsed Booking.com that that particular room sleeps 3 adult. The staff informed me that the hotel has small rooms and I said it is okay since we will be out most of the time, all we need is a clean, safe place to sleep and bathe, and I am willing to  pay extra. But according to the staff, it is hotel policy just 2 pax per room. I told her how come booking.com had the option of 3 pax in their hotel (see photo.attached),the staff insisted they can't do that. I was getting irritated already because of the attitude of the staff. My sons even told me the staffs are rude, which I believe is true. It was my youngest son's birthday and I do not want to upset him since part of the trip is his celebration. If I cancel our booking and transfer to another hotel which when I checked can sleep 3 pax (a 5 star hotel at a price lower than this hotel), I will forfeit my 1 night which is about S$350.00. And besides, I can see the disappointment already in my sons's face. I was compelled to book another room and I asked if it is possible to have an early check in. Again, in a cold manner, the staff informed me that it is not possible, the hotel is fully booked, we can check in at 3PM. So we decided to stay in the lounge for a couple of hours for the restaurants to open for breakfast. At around 4:30 AM a couple of what looked like locals arrived for check-in. So I asked, how come when we requested for early check-in, the staff said they are fully booked. The staff said they are using points.",Reviewed: 28 September 2022,2024-02-11T07:35:06.237Z
