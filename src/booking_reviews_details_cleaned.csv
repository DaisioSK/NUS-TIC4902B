The staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly. The rooms are spacious and modern, and the kitchen facilities came in handy. We had a nice view from a high floor. (See photos.) The location was in the business district, so there weren't a lot of restaurants around there and things were pretty quiet over the weekend, but it was in a great location. We were two blocks from the market with the hawker food stalls, and the metro was right across the street.  Because we were centrally located, we were able to walk to the Gardens on the Bay, The Marina Sands, the river/bay areas,  and Chinatown.  Our flight out of Singapore was very late and we had to check out of our room around noon, but there was a nice room available for lounging, watching TV, snacking, etc. that was available to us after we checked out.  The receptionist also said we could have access to the pool and shower facilities if we needed it after check out.","There were some issues with maintenance in our room. There had been some sort of leak from the bathroom and some of the floorboards just outside the bath were buckled, making it a bit dangerous for bare feet. Also, the door trim at the bath door was rotted, probably from the leak. It may have been an isolated incident in this particular room, but these sorts of things were unsightly, unsafe, and should have been repaired, particularly in a hotel of this caliber.  The AC worked well, but there wasn't a way to turn off the fan without turning off the air conditioner completely. It would have been nice to have the automatic style AC that shuts the fan off when the room gets to the proper temperature. The bed was a bit too firm for my tastes, but otherwise the room was comfortable.",10/11/2023,10/02/2024,scot baffle singapore wonderful hotel staff exceptionally helpful friendly room spacious modern kitchen facility come handy nice view high floor see photo location business district lot restaurant around thing pretty quiet weekend great location two block market hawker food stall retro right across street generally locate able walk garden bay marina sand riverbank area chinatown flight singapore late check room around noon nice room available lounge watch smack etc available check reception also say could access pool shower facility need check,issue maintenance room sort leak bathroom floorboard outside bath buckle make bit dangerous bare foot also door trim bath door rot probably leak may isolate incident particular room sort thing unsightly safe repair particularly hotel calibre ac work well way turn fan without turn air condition completely would nice automatic style ac shut fan room get proper temperature bed bit firm taste otherwise room comfortable

I particularly appreciate the self-operating laundry facilities (coin machines); very convenient.,The design of the toilet/shower should have been better designed.

The view from the rooms are just stunning.","Unfortunately, the AC-only ventilation in the rooms wasn't my cup of tea, and there was a noticeable lingering smell. Maintenance seemed a bit overlooked; the shower water flow issue turned the whole floor into a wet zone.The primary concern lies in the check out process, a crucial and lasting impression on guests. Unfortunately they were disorganised and inefficient. Hotels are well-aware of peak hours and check out times, which just leads to the conclusion that the management has not effectively streamlined its operations. Using Covid as an excuse for the failed management just outlines the failure of the management to train its employees correctly. Express check-outs, self check in services are not preferred nor wanted by guests, which the hotel can clearly see from their daily operations. Employees should appreciate that guests prefer the human interaction, as the implementation of AI and digitalisation will diminish their requirements to perform this job. Indicating for job security you should not only be more organised but more motivated to provide a service. Failing to do so, jeopardises your job and this will come faster than an employee might think. Hence more personal interactions, improved and organised service are not only required, but surely wanted from the majority of the guests.",29/01/2024,10/02/2024,first impression last impression surely leave long last impression check service great sever friendly motivate staff location hotel great go suite city even mrs everything walk distance meet also close view room stunning,unfortunately ventilator room cup tea noticeable linger smell maintenance seem bit overlook shower water flow issue turn whole floor wet zonethe primary concern lie check process crucial last impression guest unfortunately disorganise efficient hotel delaware peak hour check time lead conclusion management effectively streamline operation use could excuse fail management outline failure management train employee correctly express checkout self check service prefer want guest hotel clearly see daily operation employee appreciate guest prefer human interaction implementation ai digitalisation diminish requirement perform job indicate job security organise motivate provide service fail jeopardize job come fast employee might think hence personal interaction improve organise service require surely want majority guest

From check in to check out all the staff we encountered were so lovely and helpful and patient (important as we were travelling with energetic children). The kids loved getting a balloon and lollypop at check in, then the bracelet for free ice cream in the afternoons was a hit. After check in they also brought us up slippers and children dental kits which the kids loved. When the kids found out the pool was 24 hrs they were so excited. We had a late night swim (around 9pm) and it was beautiful, the lights from the hotel and gardens made for a beautiful setting. The rooms were beautiful (we had a fabulous twin and fabulous king) and so roomy. Bathrooms were huge! Buffet breakfast was one of the best we have ever been to. Everything was so fresh, coffee's made to order, select meals that could be ordered fresh as part of the buffet, even a pour your own bloody mary section. The breakfast was a hit with the kids and adults. We loved the pool during the day, plenty of sun lounges and shady seats. Swim up bar, water slide, hammocks, honestly we were blown away. Check out was smooth. We were even able to have complimentary late checkout on one of our rooms so we could enjoy the pool longer. Restaurants and bar on site and also plenty within walking distance. I wish we had stayed longer than 1 night and we can't wait to come back","The only thing we could fault is that the location is a bit secluded so if you're planning to do all the touristy things at Sentosa (beaches, resorts world etc) it's not part of the beach shuttle and monorail area. We had done all that already so we were able to just relax and enjoy all the W had to offer.

Suited our family of 5 (with 3 teenage daughters) well for a weeks holidays in Singapore. Last time in Singapore we stayed in the Shangri La on Sentosa.  Fraser suites turned out to be less than a third of the price. The bedrooms were a little smaller but broadly comparable in quality with the added bonus of a kitchen, dining and living area as well as laundry. The shopping centre below the apartments has a fantastic french bakery, a little farms (which seems to be the Singapore equivalent of Wholefoods) and a cheaper Fairprice supermarket. Pool is lovely and never busy. Gym is nicely sited too. Wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere next time we have a family break in Singapore.

If you plan to pay via booking.com, make sure you have ample extra money on your card as you might get charged twice. In saying that the hotel did a good job at promptly replying to my issue. Another minor point, I'm just being picky at this point, was the smell of the rooms. They've obviously been newly renovated so the smell of fresh plaster and paint is still prevalent. Also, the hotel does well and truly inform you but there was still renovations going on. Don't plan a red eye flight if you can avoid it as it (what I can only assume was jack-hammering) didn't stop until about 3pm.

The pillows in my hotel room bedroom were phenomenal. I would recommend a stay at this hotel to anyone.","The building is a thin, 30 story structure with only four lifts located around a central core. Given the narrow plot on which the hotel was built this is understandable, but it does mean one at times would be waiting for a lift to come for quite some time, and once in it, the lift would stop frequently before reaching its destination.

The rooms are large, and there are facilities for cooking, fridge, and laundry. The pool looks nice though I didn't use it.  It's very secure, with card entry to every interior of the building. There are two blocks to the site.   I arrived after 10pm and though the reception had closed, there was a night security officer who handled the check in process efficiently.  Location is a bit so, so. It's a 10 minute walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT and a 12 minute walk to Outram Park MRT.  I suggest Tanjong Pagar because the walking path towards the other MRT isn't well paved at certain parts of the way. The walk to Tanjong Pagar MRT is ok, but you will have to walk through construction sites at the time I was there i.e. Sept 2023.","I booked a medium sized room for Sept 2023. I arrived late at night and the Taxi driver wasn't sure how to get into the building. Signage is poor and as the place isn't well known, getting into the building is a hit and miss.  The site isn't well lit and we were uncertain about where to go. There are 2 blocks to the site. The block away from the barrier entry is the one you want to go to.  This is supposed to be a non-smoking place, but the minute I entered the room, an upsetting pong of stale smoke engulfed me. I complained to the night security but he couldn't do anything. They could've at least upgraded me for one night to a room elsewhere, but since he didn't have the authority, he offered me a can of room spray. He was helpful but this kind of situation should have been solved instead of submitting a guest to a stifling air. That was an unpleasant first night especially since the windows could not be opened.   However, they changed my room the next day quite effectively. But no apologies were offered.   Nothing else to complain about but do take note that this is a shared-resources facility, there is a communal kitchen on each level and is located towards one end of the block. This means if your room is on the other end, it'll be a long walk just to make coffee. Fridge space is also a premium. Don't expect any mini fridge or kettle in the room, unless you are living in one of the larger apartments. The TV is smart but there are no free to air TV channels to watch.  Finally, the gardens are a bit unkempt.

The dishwasher has a sticker on it to indicate if it’s clean or dirty, and people will disregard it.The lack of forks is rather disturbing (so is the lack of chopsticks) but we learned that the problem is not that the hostel doesn’t provide guests with forks, but rather that guests, fearing that there are no clean forks when they come to have lunch or dinner, will take them in their room, just to be sure to have access to them. Pretty individualistic behavior, as I stated earlier.Lastly, the “common working area” is very great, but again, some guests seem to have no issue with letting their kids run around and scream, providing difficult working conditions.The staff doesn’t do much to help, they will no go out of their way to resolve these situations or enforce the rules, but they are really nice to talk to.",25/10/2022,11/02/2024,I particularly enjoy location close provide cheap quality japanese fodthere plenty room equipment cook everything clean lot amenity,first big issue place really good major drawback sadly control guest behaviorsome people really nice guest clearly use live share space individualistic selfish behavior plain rude guestsfor instance guest care whether dishwasher clean simply throw dish inside let sink staff wash dishwasher stick indicate clean dirty people disregard lack fork rather disturb lack chopstick learn problem hostel provide guest fork rather guest fear clean fork come lunch dinner take room sure access pretty individualistic behavior I state earlierlastly common work area great guest seem issue let kiss run around scream provide difficult work conditionsthe staff much help go way resolve situation enforce rule really nice talk

We stayed in the medium room, which is perfect size for a couple. We almost chose the Small, but glad we didn't as I think it would have been too cramped for 2 people sharing. Amenities are great. Very central to most major attractions of Singapore, and if the attraction isn't close by, the MRT or bus routes get you to anywhere you want to be in no time. Grabs are also reasonably priced to most locations. About a 15-20 minute ride from Changi Airport. Will definitely stay here again when staying in Singapore.","Not much, but only thing I didn't like is the fact that the shower doesn't have a water panel to stop the water from running out to the rest of the bathroom floor. It constantly created a mess, so the floor was always wet. I wish they would have a small barrier for the water. House keeping times/days are also very confusing as some days we didn't have enough toilet paper because they didn't always come a replenish the towels and toilet paper, so we had to go and get some in the general wash wash room/gym washroom as there is extra there.  Because the coffee machine is very poplar, sugar and coffee and cups were sometimes scarce and on our last few days there was no sugar.

I could hear flushing sounds and screaming from the room above us. Morning hours are especially bad so maybe bring some ear buds with you.- Windows are sealed shut (which helps greatly with keeping the bugs from coming in) but also makes the room very stuffy quickly.

Now, if you want to be close to Marina Bay/Merlion/Gardens by the Bay, this is probably not the hotel for you.  We stayed here for 2 nights and at the Ritz Carlton Millenia for 2 nights so we can be closer to the city centre, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Katong and highly recommend that you experience it for yourself.Loved the rooftop pool.Staff are very friendly.P.s. I changed my score from 9 to 10 because after reviewing my other hotel reviews, I don't think it would be fair to not give it a 10!",The only negative is not having a luggage rack in the room or a dedicated space for luggage.  There is some closet space for suitcases and luggage but it was inconvenient to open and close the closet door.

Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena,Beautique,Philippines,Guest Room King ,2.0,2022-09-01,Family,DISAPPOINTING. WILL NEVER CHECK IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN. WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE,1.0,"Nothing extra-ordinary with this hotel to pay  S$1,427.34 for 2 nights for 3 pax. I had the worst hotel experience in this hotel. The staff are cold and impolite, and my sons said they are rude. Aside from the problem we encountered during check-in, wherein I was compelled to book another room (staff said it is the fault of Booking.com} we also had issue with breakfast, I reserved for 4 pax (for my 2 sons and business partner who came over for a meeting) because they offered a discounted rate of S$25 per pax when we checked in. While we were having breakfast, the restaurant staff informed me that only 2 were reserved and I had to pay $36/pax for the other 2.  Imagine, in the middle of having breakfast, the staff will tell me that. I totally lost my appetite.  It is just a matter of 11 dollars but to tell me that in the middle of breakfast, that is unacceptable and unprofessional. And I have not moved on for paying additional S$758 for another room, whereinfact I saw at Booking.com that they really have that option.  They are NOT ORGANIZED to the expense of causing inconvenience to the customer. WE TOTALLY REGRET STAYING AT THIS HOTEL.","I had the worst hotel experience from this hotel in my entire life. We flew in to Singapore very early, arrived in the hotel at around 3 AM, taking our chances of an early check in. I was with my 2 sons for business and pleasure. When we arrived at the hotel, we were asked if we checking in together, no Good morning or how are you? I was informed that we need 2 book 2 rooms to accomodate 3 pax.I told the hotel staff that I booked the extra large king size room because I saw when I browsed Booking.com that that particular room sleeps 3 adult. The staff informed me that the hotel has small rooms and I said it is okay since we will be out most of the time, all we need is a clean, safe place to sleep and bathe, and I am willing to  pay extra. But according to the staff, it is hotel policy just 2 pax per room. I told her how come booking.com had the option of 3 pax in their hotel (see photo.attached),the staff insisted they can't do that. I was getting irritated already because of the attitude of the staff. My sons even told me the staffs are rude, which I believe is true. It was my youngest son's birthday and I do not want to upset him since part of the trip is his celebration. If I cancel our booking and transfer to another hotel which when I checked can sleep 3 pax (a 5 star hotel at a price lower than this hotel), I will forfeit my 1 night which is about S$350.00. And besides, I can see the disappointment already in my sons's face. I was compelled to book another room and I asked if it is possible to have an early check in. Again, in a cold manner, the staff informed me that it is not possible, the hotel is fully booked, we can check in at 3PM. So we decided to stay in the lounge for a couple of hours for the restaurants to open for breakfast. At around 4:30 AM a couple of what looked like locals arrived for check-in. So I asked, how come when we requested for early check-in, the staff said they are fully booked.

It's filthy, squalid, and shockingly bad. I have reported the hostel to the Singapore health authorities, and have followed up on the report. I hope that Singapore government shuts it down. It's beyond scary.  It is by far the filthiest hostel I have ever stayed in.* The common facilities are disgusting.* The urinals are broken and covered in plastic bags.* The floors and surfaces were filthy with brown or black sticky substances. Staff made little effort to clean common areas. They just hosed down the washrooms with water and let it air dry without actually making a cleaning effort.* There were two male showers.  One was broken, and the other hand a mold or termite eaten wood sill that had used bandaids stuck into its holes.* The sink was clogged and had a pool of yellow liquid and possibly snot in it.* The male washroom door was perpetually propped open with a string cord so that some guests could dry their clothes, thereby violating any sense modesty of those using the showers as well as women passing by the door.* The soap dispensers are broken.* There was a pool of vomit on the table which was left overnight to dry.* There were guests / squatters sleeping on each of the couches throughout the hostel; I saw at least 4 squatters.* The room itself had a leaky aircon pipe which dripped ice water on me as I tried to sleep.* There were used bandaids wedged into the shower and a used rusty razor blade shoved into the shower's water heater.The hostel attracted the worst people, and most inconsiderate roommates.
