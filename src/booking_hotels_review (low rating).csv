Dangerous,1,I liked nothing. This is the worst hostel I've ever stayed in. It was a nightmare.  Avoid at all costs.,"Nightmare.  Avoid this place at all costs. Worst hostel I've ever stayed in.  It's filthy, squalid, and shockingly bad. I have reported the hostel to the Singapore health authorities, and have followed up on the report. I hope that Singapore government shuts it down. It's beyond scary.  It is by far the filthiest hostel I have ever stayed in.* The common facilities are disgusting.* The urinals are broken and covered in plastic bags.* The floors and surfaces were filthy with brown or black sticky substances. Staff made little effort to clean common areas. They just hosed down the washrooms with water and let it air dry without actually making a cleaning effort.* There were two male showers.  One was broken, and the other hand a mold or termite eaten wood sill that had used bandaids stuck into its holes.* The sink was clogged and had a pool of yellow liquid and possibly snot in it.* The male washroom door was perpetually propped open with a string cord so that some guests could dry their clothes, thereby violating any sense modesty of those using the showers as well as women passing by the door.* The soap dispensers are broken.* There was a pool of vomit on the table which was left overnight to dry.* There were guests / squatters sleeping on each of the couches throughout the hostel; I saw at least 4 squatters.* The room itself had a leaky aircon pipe which dripped ice water on me as I tried to sleep.* There were used bandaids wedged into the shower and a used rusty razor blade shoved into the shower's water heater.The hostel attracted the worst people, and most inconsiderate roommates. Guests take calls and speak loudly at all hours.  One roommate took a call at 3am and spoke loudly for 30 minutes. Another roommate woke up at 6am and turned on overhead light and kept it on for over an hour before I left to change hostels.Staff was unhelpful.",Reviewed: 3 July 2022,2024-02-11T08:05:51.181Z

K Space Inn 569,Angelita,Bangladesh,Single Space Pod (No Window),3 nights · December 2022,Solo traveller,"Except few drawbacks, It’s worth the money.",8,I liked the podium but would have been better if it was a bit bigger and if they had a small fan inside connected cuz the aircon doesnt really reach inside unless the curtain is open so was a bit warm inside but still good.The lighting and mirror inside really amazed me and the guy was in reception was really helpful and helped me out to carry my luggage upstairs due to not having any elevator. i loved my staying there. It’s not like other hostels Where you can get socially connected but worth the money if you like ur own company.,"I low-key didn’ like the location but only because there wasn’t enough space for drop off or pick up. other than that, everything was pretty okay. there was a shopping mall nearby and a MRT station few blocks away which is still considered good. but the cleaning was not really good at all. washroom was always dirty. even though i complained to the lady, she didn’ take any action. the room had dust mostly which comes to ur pod if ur shade is open. on top of that, if you want younger people to hangout with as a solo traveler and chill then this is not what you’re looking for but enjoying own company or if u stay outside most of the time, then Its a cool place to stay for few days.",Reviewed: 21 January 2023,2024-02-11T08:17:22.987Z
